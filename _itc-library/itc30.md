    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We show that a fluid-flow interpretation of Service Curve Earliest Deadline First (SCED) scheduling simplifies deadline derivations for this scheduler.  By exploiting the recently reported isomorphism between min-plus and max-plus network calculus and expressing deadlines in a max-plus algebra deadline computations no longer require pseudo-inverse computations. SCED deadlines are provided for general convex or concave piecewise linear service curves.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS), which provides the theoretical underpinnings for fair packet scheduling algorithms, has been studied extensively. However, a tight formulation of the available service of a flow only exists for traffic that is regulated by affine arrival envelopes and constant-rate links. In this paper, we show that the universal service curve by Parekh and Gallager can be extended to concave arrival envelopes and links with time-variable capacity. We also dispense with the previously existing assumption of a stable system.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Ingress Egress Traffic Matrix (IE TM) assessment is a fundamental step of the network management for an ISP network, since the TM represents the key input parameter used by any Traffic Engineering solutions able to optimize the resource utilization and to improve the Quality of Service. The actual TM assessment procedure are based on estimation algorithms or measurement based approaches. This paper presents a method to measure the intensity of traffic flows, that overcomes the limits of the classical measurement/estimation based approaches. The idea is to exploit the flexibility of the Segment Routing paradigm to implement controlled routing changes so that to measure the intensity of a subset of network flows. The main contribution of the work is show the feasibility of the proposed approach by means of a low complexity heuristic, referred to as Path Cost Bases (PaCoB), able to identify the list of routing changes that allow to improve the TM assessment procedure. The heuristic is composed of successive steps, referred to as snapshots: in each snapshot the routing of a set of flows is changed so that to assess their intensities. The performance evaluation shows that PaCoB assesses the intensity of more than 90% of flows. Moreover, when used in conjunction with an estimation algorithm, PaCoB allows to reduce the estimation error by more than 50% with 10 snapshots.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent research has put forward the concept of Fog computing, a deported intelligence for IoT networks. Fog clusters are meant to complement current cloud deployments, providing compute and storage resources directly in the access network - which is particularly useful for low-latency applications. However, Fog deployments are expected to be less elastic than cloud platforms, since elasticity in Cloud platforms comes from the scale of the data-centers. Thus, a Fog node dimensioned for the average traffic load of a given application will be unable to handle sudden bursts of traffic. In this paper, we explore such a use-case, where a Fog-based latency-sensitive application must offload some of its processing to the Cloud. We build an analytical queueing model for deriving the statistical response time of a Fog deployment under different request Load Balancing (LB) strategies, contrasting a naive, an ideal (LFU-LB, assuming a priori knowledge of the request popularity) and a practical (LRU-LB, based on online learning of the popularity with an LRU filter) scheme. Using our model, and confirming the results through simulation, we show that the LRU-LB achieves close-to- ideal performance, with high savings on Cloud offload cost with respect to a request-oblivious strategy in the explored scenarios.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Hands-on computer networking labs are essential in many computer science curricula. They are conducted either on physical testbeds consisting of PCs, routers, switches, cables, etc., or on fully virtualized testbeds. The latter consist of only virtual machines (VM) that can be interconnected via software configuration. Fully virtualized testbeds require less resources (hardware, space, energy) than physical testbeds but students miss important hands-on experience with networking equipment. In this work, we present a semi-virtualized testbed: students are given physical access to networking interfaces of VMs via patch panels so that they can interconnect them through cables. Similarly to virtualized testbeds, the semi-virtualized testbed requires only little hardware and maintenance effort while preserving the hands-on experience of physical testbeds. We present a Python-based orchestration platform for several virtual student workspaces on a single physical server. Each virtual student workspace contains several VMs acting as clients, servers, and routers that can be configured by students. It is made available to a physical workspace on a 19-inch cabinet consisting of a thin client and patch panels allowing students to physically interconnect their VMs with cables.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> As network speed increases, servers struggle to serve all requests directed at them. This challenge is rooted in a partitioned data path where the split between the kernel space networking stack and user space applications induces overheads. To address this challenge, we propose Santa, a architecture to optimize the data path by enabling server applications to (partially) offload packet processing to a generic rule processor. We exemplify Santa by showing how it can drastically accelerate kernel-based UDP packet processingâ\text\euro''a currently neglected domain. Our evaluation focuses on accelerating DNS server for which we find a performance increase by a factor of 5.5.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In an Internet-of-Things system where status data are collected from sensors and actuators for time-critical applications, the freshness of data is vital and can be quantified by the recently proposed age-of-information (AoI) metric. In this paper, we first consider a general scenario where multiple terminals share a common channel to transmit or receive randomly generated status packets. The optimal scheduling problem to minimize AoI is formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit problem. To solve the problem efficiently, we derive the Whittle's index in closed-form and establish the indexability thereof. Compared with existing work, we extend the index policy for AoI optimization to incorporate stochastic packet arrivals and optimal packet management (buffering the latest packet), and consequently a more challenging two-dimensional states system. Inspired by the index policy which has near-optimal performance but is centralized by nature, a decentralized status update scheme, i.e., the index-prioritized random access policy (IPRA), is further proposed, achieving universally near-optimal AoI performance and outperforming state-of-the-arts in the literature.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> DiffServ was designed to implement service provider quality of service (QoS) policies, where ingress and egress routers change the DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) in the IP header. However, nowadays, applications are beginning to directly set the DSCP themselves, in the hope that this will yield a more appropriate service for their respective video, audio and data streams. WebRTC is a prime example of such an application.As a first step towards understanding whether ``WebRTC QoS works'' we measured for both IPv4 and IPv6 what happens to DSCP values along Internet paths. Our study is based on end-to-end measurements from 160 IPv4 and 65 IPv6 geographically spread controlled probe clients to 34 IPv4 and 18 IPv6 servers respectively. Clearly when the DSCP value is changed the net result may not be what the application desired. We find that this happens often and conclude with recommendations on how to improve WebRTC and other applications using the DSCP.\dq

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Satisfying the needs of users of online video streaming services requires not only managing the network Quality of Service (QoS), but also to address the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) expectations. In fact, while QoS factors reflect the status of individual networks they do not comprehensively capture the end-to-end features affecting the quality delivered to the user. In this situation, QoE management is the better option. However, currently used QoE management models are subjective to human interaction and have stringent requirements in terms of time and complexity. Thus, they fail to achieve successful performance in terms of real-timeliness, accuracy, scalability and adaptability. This dissertation work investigates new methods to bring QoE management to the level required by the real-time management of services. In this paper we highlight our main contributions. First, with the aim to perform a combined network-service assessment, we have designed an experimental methodology able to map network QoS onto service QoE. Our methodology is meant to provide service and network providers with the means to pinpoint the working boundaries of their video-sets and to predict the effect of network policies on perception. Second, we have designed and developed a generic machine learning framework that allows deriving accurate predictive No Reference (NR) assessment metrics, based on simplistic NR QoE methods, that are functionally and computationally viable for real-time QoE evaluation. The tools, methods and conclusions derived from this dissertation conform a solid contribution to QoE management of video streaming services, opening new venues for further research and investigation.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> From the point of view of telecommunication providers, video streaming is one of the most demanding applications in today's Internet. Over 73% of the total global network traffic has been attributed to video streaming applications in 2017. In this work, we provide a first step towards a better understanding of the packet level behavior of video streaming traffic to enable more efficient traffic engineering in the future. We perform a measurement study with the popular video streaming platform YouTube and show that the different playout phases of a video streaming session can not only be observed by evaluating application layer metrics, but also from raw and encrypted packet level traces.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems can provide high data rates, but the system performance may degrade significantly due to mobile blockers and the user's own body. A high frequency of interruptions and long duration of blockage may degrade the quality of experience. Macrodiversity of base stations (BSs) has been considered a promising solution where the user equipment (UE) can handover to other available BSs, if the current serving BS gets blocked. However, an analytical model to evaluate the system performance of dynamic blockage events in this setting is largely unknown. In this paper, we consider an open park-like scenario and obtain closed-form expressions for the blockage probability, the expected frequency and duration of blockage events using stochastic geometry. Our results indicate that the minimum density of BS that is required to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of AR/VR and other Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) applications is largely driven by blockage events rather than capacity requirements. As an alternative to increasing BS density, placing the BS at a greater height reduces the likelihood of blockage. We present a closed-form expression for the BS density-height trade-off that can be used for network planning.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> As the demand of Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming to mobile devices increases, novel optimization transport techniques need to be designed to cope with these ultra-high-bandwidth video services. One approach currently attracting attention is the application of adaptive tile-based streaming solutions to the VR video arena. The VR videos are encoded at different quality levels, temporally divided into segments and spatially split into tiles. During the streaming, each of these tiles can be transmitted independently according to its location within the frame (i.e., within or outside of the user's field of view). These methods open a new venue for bandwidth and latency optimization for the streaming of VR videos. However, the effect of the different adaptive streaming optimizations on the end-user perception is still an open research topic. In this demo, we present a VR video platform to experience the working principles of adaptive tile-based VR video streaming services. Through different tiling approaches, bandwidth conditions and viewport algorithms, it allows the users to explore the effects that each optimization has on the perception of the service. In addition, the platform provides real-time bandwidth savings and objective Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements to provide a quantitative analysis of the optimizations effects. This demo aims to provide a common playground for researchers to benchmark, and evaluate the performance of their optimization solutions.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The problem of WiFi and LTE coexistence has been significantly debated in the last years, with the emergence of LTE extensions enabling the utilization of unlicensed spectrum for carrier aggregation. Since the two technologies employ completely different access protocols and frame transmission times, supporting coexistence with minimal modifications on existing protocols is not an easy task. Current solutions are often based on LTE unilateral adaptations, being LTE in unlicensed bands still under definition. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid a subordinated role for WiFi nodes, by simply equipping WiFi nodes with a sensing mechanism based on adaptive tunings of the ambient noise thresholds (as indeed considered by several commercial cards). Under this assumption, we propose a winwin coexistence mechanism between the two technologies, that does not require modifications on legacy WiFi access operations. We model the interactions between the two technologies in terms of a game and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in simulation and in real experiments.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, energy harvesting has taken a considerable attention in wireless communication research. Nonetheless, the stochastic nature of renewable energy sources has become one of the research problems, and energy storage has been proposed as a solution to deal with it. Initially, researchers regarded a perfect battery model without energy losses during storage because of its simplicity and compatibility in wireless communication analysis. However, a battery model that reflects practical concerns should include energy losses. In this paper, we consider an energy harvesting wireless communication model with a battery that has energy losses during charging and discharging. We consider energy underflows (i.e., the energy level falls below a certain threshold in a battery) as the energy management concern, and characterize the energy underflow probability and provide a simple exponential formulation by employing the large deviation principle and queueing theory. Specifically, we benefit from the similarity between the battery and data buffer models. We further coin the available space decay rate at a battery as a parameter to indicate the energy consumption performance. We further outline an approach to set the energy demand policy to meet the energy management requirements that rule the energy underflow probability as a constraint. We finally substantiate our analytical findings with numerical demonstrations, and compare the transmission performance levels of a transmission system with a battery that has energy losses and a transmission system that consumes the energy as soon as it is harvested.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Dispatching systems, where jobs are routed to servers immediately upon arrival, appear frequently in parallel computing systems. With a dynamic dispatching policy, the system is generally analytically intractable and performance evaluation is carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A typical performance metric is the mean response time that is often easy to estimate. In contrast, we consider systems where events generating costs are extremely rare. In our reference system, jobs have deadlines for waiting time. When deadlines are loose when compared to the system's load, novel rare event simulation techniques must be applied. We consider both conditioning and importance sampling to this end. The proposed techniques are demonstrated in numerical examples, where we discover interesting performance relationships between the classical dispatching policies; Random split (RND), Round-robin (RR), Join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) and Least-work-left (LWL).

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper explores the full chain of lag contribution factors in a specific online multiplayer game, namely Overwatch: From creating input events over the network and back to displaying the results on the local screen. Together result in the dreaded end-to-end lag. which has a direct impact on the subjective quality one experiences when playing video games. In its investigation, this paper reveals surprising effects in the game's networking behavior that are omitted when colloquially talking about, e.g. a 60 Hz update rate, but must be considered nonetheless. These insights, gained from examining network traces of Overwatch matches that were played on a realistic, resource constrained PC, can then be used to refine end-to-end lag simulation models and reach a better understanding of all responsible components.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Due to the staggering increase of mobile traffic, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are facing considerable operational cost due to power supply. Renewable Energy (RE) sources to power Base Stations (BSs) represent a promising solution to lower the energy bill, but their intermittent nature may affect the service continuity and the system self-sufficiency. Furthermore,  in the new energy market dominated by the Smart Grid,  new potentialities arise for MNOs in a Demand Response (DR) framework,  since they can dynamically modulate the mobile network energy demand in accordance with SG requests,  thus obtaining significant rewards. This work proposes various stochastic models to reliably and accurately characterize the RE production and the operation of a green mobile network, also analyzing the impact of parameter quantization on the model performance. The RE system dimensioning is investigated,  trading off cost saving and feasibility constraints,  and evaluating the impact of Resource on Demand (RoD) strategies,  that allow to achieve more than 40% cost reduction. Finally,  by exploiting RoD and WiFi offloading techniques,  various energy management policies are designed to enhance the interaction of a green mobile network with the SG in a DR framework,  leading to fully erase the energy bill and even gain positive revenues.\dq

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> A recently proposed congestion control algorithm(CCA) called BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time) has shown a lot of promise in avoiding the bufferbloat and low-buffer inefficiency problems that have plagued loss-based CCAs. Nevertheless deployment of a new alternative algorithm requires a thorough evaluation of the effect of the proposed alternative on established transport protocols like TCP CUBIC. Furthermore,  evaluations that consider the heterogeneity of Internet traffic sizes would provide a useful insight into the deployability of an algorithm that introduces sweeping changes across multiple algorithm components. Yet most evaluations of BBR's impact and competitive fairness have focused on the steady-state performance of large flows. This work expands on previous studies of BBR by evaluating BBR's impact when the traffic consists of flows of different sizes. Our experiments show that under certain circumstances BBR's startup phase can result in a significant reduction of the throughput of competing large CUBIC flows and the utilization of the bottleneck link. In addition  the steady-state operation of BBR can have negative impact on the performance of bursty flows using loss-based CCAs over bottlenecks with buffer sizes as high as two times the bandwidth-delay product.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Frequent variations in throughput make mobile networks a challenging environment for video streaming. Current video players deal with those variations by matching video quality to network throughput. However, this adaptation strategy results in frequent changes of video resolution and bitrate, which negatively impacts the users' streaming experience. Alternatively, keeping the video quality constant would improve the experience, but puts additional demand on the network. Downloading high quality content when channel quality is low requires additional resources, because data transfer efficiency is linked to channel quality. In this paper, we present a predictive Channel Quality based Buffering Strategy (CQBS) that lets the video buffer grow when channel quality is good, and relies on this buffer when channel quality decreases. Our strategy is the outcome of a Markov Decision Process. The underlying Markov chain is conditioned on 377 real-world LTE channel quality traces that we have collected using an Android mobile application. With our strategy, mobile network providers can deliver constant quality video streams, without sacrificing additional network resources.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Stochastic network calculus (SNC) is a versatile framework to derive probabilistic performance bounds. Recently, it was proposed in [1] to replace the typical a priori assumptions on arrival processes with measurement observations and to incorporate the corresponding statistical uncertainty into calculation of the bounds. This so-called statistical network calculus (StatNC) opens the door for many applications with limited traffic information. However, the important traffic class of self-similar processes such as fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) was left open in [1], thus, e.g., depriving the usage of the StatNC for Internet traffic. In this work, we close this gap by integrating fBm arrivals into the StatNC. To this end, we analyze the impact imposed by the uncertainty on the backlog bound and show in numerical evaluations that the additional inaccuracy is only of moderate size.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we present LENTA (Longitudinal Exploration for Network Traffic Analysis), a system that allows the network analyst to easily identify traffic generated by services and applications running on the web, being them benign or possibly malicious. First, LENTA simplifies analysts job by letting them observe few hundreds of clusters instead of the original hundred thousands of single URLs. Second, it implements a self-learning methodology, where a semi-supervised approach lets the system grow its knowledge, which is used in turn to automatically associate traffic to previously observed services and identify new traffic generated by possibly suspicious applications. This lets the analyst easily observe changes in the traffic, like the birth of new services, or unexpected activities. We follow a data driven approach, running LENTA on real data. Traffic is analyzed in batches of 24-hour worth of traffic. We show that LENTA allows the analyst to easily understand which services are running on its network, highlights malicious traffic and changes over time, greatly simplifying the view and understanding of the traffic.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We compute bounds on end-to-end worst-case latency and on nodal backlog size for a per-class deterministic network that implements Credit Based Shaper (CBS) and Asynchronous Traffic Shaping (ATS), as proposed by the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standardization group. ATS is an implementation of the Interleaved Regulator, which reshapes traffic in the network before admitting it into a CBS buffer, thus avoiding burstiness cascades. Due to the interleaved regulator, traffic is reshaped at every switch, which allows for the computation of explicit delay and backlog bounds. Furthermore, we obtain a novel, tight per-flow bound for the response time of CBS, when the input is regulated, which is smaller than existing network calculus bounds. We also compute a per-flow bound on the response time of the interleaved regulator. Based on all the above results, we compute bounds on the per-class backlogs. Then, we use the newly computed delay bounds along with recent results on interleaved regulators from literature to derive tight end-to-end latency bounds and show that these are less than the sums of per-switch delay bounds.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, a framework is developed to estimate the mean delay performance of \$($\backslash$pi, $\backslash$rho,$\backslash$sigma)\$ regulated flows in networks with acyclic routing. We first show that the mean delay performance can be bounded by \textiton-off type processes with exponentially distributed \textitoff periods. We then obtain per-flow bounds on the mean delay. We show that when there is no peak rate constraint, the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for \$M/G/1\$ queues provides a tight bound thus establishing the Better-than-Poisson property for such flows. We then consider flows inside a network and show that they can be characterized by a stochastic burstiness parameter and show how the aggregate performance can be bounded from the asymptotic Better-than-Poisson property of regulated flows.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we consider a random access IoT wireless network assisted by two aggregators. The nodes and the aggregators are transmitting in a random access manner under slotted time, the aggregators use network-level cooperation. We assume that all the nodes are sharing the same wireless channel to transmit their data to a common destination. The aggregators with out-of-band full duplex capability, are equipped with queues to store data packets that are transmitted by the network nodes and relaying them to the destination node. We characterize the throughput performance of the IoT network. In addition, we obtain the stability conditions for the queues at the aggregators and the average delay of the packets.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Stochastic network calculus is a tool for computing error bounds on the performance of queueing systems. However, deriving accurate bounds for networks consisting of several queues or subject to non-independent traffic inputs is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the relevance of the tools from analytic combinatorics, especially the kernel method, to tackle this problem. Applying the kernel method allows us to compute the generating functions of the queue state distributions in the stationary regime of the network. As a consequence, error bounds with an arbitrary precision can be computed. In this preliminary work, we focus on simple examples which are representative of the difficulties that the kernel method allows us to overcome.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently there has been a great interest in randomized load balancing schemes for large systems of parallel servers. Various policies such as SQ(d) (shortest queue amongst d randomly sampled), threshold policies, JIQ (join the idle queue) etc have been studied via a mean-field approach. All these policies are special cases of occupancy based routing decisions. In this paper we present a unified mean-field approach that holds for any routing scheme that only depends on the server occupancy in a system with a large numbers of of processor sharing servers as an archetype of shared resource systems. The mean-field equations we obtain hold for general job length distributions unlike most recent works that assume exponentially distributed job lengths. We then show that the probability measure of occupancy defined on the set of non-negative integers \$\mathcalZ_+\$ obtained from a fixed-point of the mean-field also satisfies the stationary mean-field equations under the assumption that the job lengths are exponential with the same average length. If the mean-field under exponential case has unique fixed-point, then the fixed point is \em insensitive to the job length distribution. The approach is via a measure-valued Markov process approach.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Cloud computing provides high flexibility for users by offering diverse cloud instances with various leasing periods and prices. Depending on the amount and duration of workload, a user can flexibly choose proper cloud instances to meet her demands. An intrinsic challenge facing the user is which classes of clouds and how many of them to purchase in order to meet her unpredictable demands at minimum cost. We consider an online problem deciding cost-effectively cloud classes and amount of clouds to meet dynamic multiple demands among many cloud classes when no future information of demands is available. We propose two online algorithms achieving O(M) and O(log M + log dmax) competitive ratios where M is the number of available cloud classes and dmax is the maximum demand of a given demand sequence.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a synopsis of ongoing research in the field of resource allocation in dynamic optical networks. This type of networks are envisioned to serve connections with random arrival and holding times and with fast connection setup requirements. Based on this, we model resource allocation as a mechanism that includes network control functions for routing and spectrum assignment (RSA), connection admission control (CAC) and grade of service (GoS) control. The goal is to efficiently assign spectrum resources to connections so as to attain optimum performance. For that, the network is modelled as a stochastic loss system subject to spectrum continuity and contiguity constraints. The theory of Markov decision processes (MDP) is then applied to formulate an algorithm that performs fast, adaptive and state-dependent RSA, CAC and GoS control. The proposed algorithm can easily be integrated with existing protocols for fast connection setup. Moreover, we discuss the cost efficiency of selected network implementations which are based on basic, colorless and colorless and directionless optical nodes.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> With the majority of video distribution services relying on the HTTP adaptive streaming paradigm, a great deal of research is geared towards developing algorithms and solutions for improving user perceived quality while making efficient use of available resources. Our goal is to provide the means for benchmarking such solutions in the context of multiple users accessing Video on Demand content while sharing a bottleneck link. For that purpose, we propose a quadratic problem formulation to compute the theoretical optimum in terms of adaptation strategies and corresponding segment downloads across multiple users under given bandwidth constraints. By aiming to maximize both service quality and fairness, we quantify and compare the impact of different fairness objectives (bandwidth fairness, pattern fairness, and session fairness) on resulting quality and achieved QoE fairness. Based on conducted simulations and parameter studies, our results demonstrate the benefits of optimizing for session fairness as compared to other approaches.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm offers network operators numerous improvements in terms of flexibility, scalability, as well as cost efficiency and vendor independence. However, in order to maximize the benefit from these features, several new challenges in areas such as management and orchestration need to be addressed. The dissertation that is summarized in this paper makes contributions towards three key topics from these areas. Firstly,  we design, implement, and evaluate two multi-objective heuristics for the SDN controller placement problem. Secondly,  we develop and apply mechanisms for automated decision making based on the Pareto frontiers that are returned by the multi-objective optimizers. Finally,  we investigate and quantify the performance benefits for the SDN control plane that can be achieved by integrating information from external entities such as Network Management Systems (NMSs) into the control loop. Our evaluation results demonstrate the impact of optimizing various parameters of softwarized networks at different levels and are used to derive guidelines for an efficient operation.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Container based virtualization is widely used in cloud computing. Applying such virtualization to IoT devices with much smaller footprint promises considerable benefits. This paper presents the results of a performance evaluation of system container virtualization like LXC provisioned on small MIPS or ARM based embedded microprocessors that can be used in edge or fog of an IoT ecosystem. The measurement results using different benchmark tools show that the overhead introduced has only negligible effects on the overall performance of the embedded microprocessors.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We address the performance of a system where D2D communications add up to standard cellular traffic in future 5G networks. D2D resources are taken from the Uplink spectrum and, in this framework, two scheduling schemes are envisaged: the first one consists in two independent schedulers working on separate subsets of the Uplink channel, respectively dedicated to Uplink cellular communications and to D2D communications; the second one is a joint scheduler making use of the whole Uplink channel. In both schemes, all communications are scheduled, which in particular avoids the intra-cell interference issue. We propose multi-class Processor Sharing queueing models which account for realistic cellular radio conditions and provide traffic performance in terms of the average throughput for the different classes of flows. From the considered numerical scenarios, we conclude that the joint Uplink scheduling scheme provides better performance and allows D2D users to make an efficient use of their higher potential capacity, due to the device proximity. The corresponding throughput is also shown to be significantly higher than that perceived without any dedicated D2D link.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm has become a potential solution dealing with the rapid growth of the global Internet traffic in the last decades. There, network appliances are transformed into Virtual Network Functions (VNF) running on standard server. This promises to significantly reduce overall cost and energy consumption. Additionally, hardware-based network function chain is replaced by a chain of the VNFs, called Service Function Chain (SFC). The expected benefit of SFC is the reduction in the complexity when deploying heterogeneous network services. However, the considerable drawback of SFC is the distribution of the VNFs over different hosts. An inefficient placement of VNFs can induce a high latency within the chain and wasted server resources.In this work we propose four placement algorithms that aim to efficiently place the SFC in servers with regard to minimizing service response time and resource utilization. Herein heuristic approaches are evaluated against optimal solutions for the placement problems which are formulated by using Integer Linear Programming. We evaluate and compare these placement strategies in a simulator. Our result shows that the optimized solutions produce lowest service response time and least server utilization in all types of simulated SFCs. On the other hand the heuristic algorithms are also able to come close to the optimum by simple placing rules.\dq

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Firewall capabilities of operating systems are traditionally provided by inflexible filter routines or hooks in the kernel. These require privileged access to be configured and are not easily extensible for custom low-level actions. Since Linux 3.0, the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) allows user-written extensions in the kernel processing path. The successor, extended BPF (eBPF), improves flexibility and is realized via a virtual machine featuring both a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and an interpreter running in the kernel. It executes custom eBPF programs supplied by the user, effectively moving kernel functionality into user space.We present two case studies on the usage of Linux eBPF. First we analyze the performance of the eXpress Data Path (XDP). XDP uses eBPF to process ingress traffic before the allocation of kernel data structures which comes along with performance benefits. In the second case study eBPF is used to install application-specific packet filtering configurations acting on the socket level. Our case studies focus on performance aspects and discuss benefits and drawbacks.\dq

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Higher link bandwidth provided by three-dimensional Network-on-Chip (3D-NoC) relies on multi-path routing and traffic splitting, which inevitably leads to out-of-order packet delivery problem when facing unbalanced traffic congestion. Therefore, a reordering mechanism, often requiring reorder buffers, is necessary to guarantee in-order delivery of packets. The reorder buffers are expensive in terms of both resource and power consumption, hence it is of great significance to reduce the reorder buffer size in the worst case. In this paper, we propose a improved Ohm's Law-like traffic splitting method, named RB-OLITS, for reducing the worst-case reorder buffer size. The traffic splitting configuration is obtained according to the parallel resistance theory. Experimental results show that RB-OLITS has reduced the worst-case reorder buffer size by 19.09% in average compared with OLITS. Meanwhile, the worst-case delay bound is not degraded by using RB-OLITS, as the worst-case delay bound of the same target flow is slightly improved by 1.59% in average.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The recent trend towards low-latency wireless communication requires a notion of non-ergodic capacity that deals with delays. Significant research in areas, such as effective capacity, delay-constrained capacity, and stochastic service curves, has contributed such results for relevant physical layer aspects, like fading processes, interference, and multiple antenna systems. Less attention has been paid to actual implementations of link layer automatic repeat request protocols. Instead, error-free transmission using instantaneous channel state information, simple stop-and-wait protocols, or instantaneous feedback are frequently assumed. In this work, we investigate protocols with pipelining that deal with packet errors under non-negligible round-trip-times. We define a stochastic service curve model of a general class of automatic repeat request protocols with pipelining and derive statistical waiting time and sojourn time bounds. We discover two regimes: under low to moderate load retransmissions cause the largest part of the sojourn time, whereas under high load the waiting time dominates the sojourn time. Generally, with increasing round-trip-time the basic cases of stop-and-wait protocols or instantaneous feedback neglect relevant effects and provide less accurate estimates.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> A major challenge in mobile video streaming applications is the variability of the wireless channel. Techniques like Apple's HLS and MPEG-DASH typically offer the video in chunks where each chunk is made available with different levels of quality and bitrate. Adaptive clients use estimates of the past network conditions to select the bitrate of the next chunk accordingly. Frequently, this selection is based on the average performance and does not consider the variability of the channel. In this work, we present a method for bitrate adaptation that uses the distribution of the past throughput to provide statistical performance guarantees obtained by the stochastic network calculus. We show how to select the bitrate so that a certain, small probability of buffer underflow is not exceeded. The results are derived for the general case of an arbitrary throughput distribution. Numerical results are included for the example of a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we present simulation results that show the relevant performance metrics like average bitrate and buffer level of a system that adjusts it's bitrate as suggested by our method. Generally, the method presented in this paper can achieve a bitrate that is close to the average available throughput with little variability of the playback rate while ensuring a defined probability of buffer underflow.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditionally science is done using the reductionism paradigm. Artificial intelligence does not make an exception and it follows the same strategy. At the same time, network science tries to study complex systems as a whole. This synopsis presents my PhD thesis which takes an alternative approach to the reductionism strategy, with the aim to advance both fields, advocating that major breakthroughs can be made when these two are combined. The thesis illustrates this bidirectional relation by: (1) proposing a new method which uses artificial intelligence to improve network science algorithms (i.e. a new centrality metric which computes fully decentralized the nodes and links importance, on the polylogarithmic scale with respect to the number of nodes in the network); and (2) proposing two methods which take inspiration from network science to improve artificial intelligence algorithms (e.g. quadratic acceleration in terms of memory requirements and computational speed of artificial neural network fully connected layers during both, training and inference).

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deterministic network calculus offers a framework for providing guaranteed bounds on end-to-end delay and buffer usage in computer networks. Various network analysis methods have been proposed in order to reduce the impact of burstiness or multiplexing and provide tight performance bounds. Yet, the choice of which analysis method to use given a network to analyze is not straightforward as it has been showed in the literature that corner cases exist leading to poor tightness. We propose in this paper to take a new look at this question using insights from data and confirm that there is no clear winner when deciding which method to use. Based on those first results, we make the case for a network calculus heuristic in order to predict the bounds produced by a given network analysis method. Our main contribution is a heuristic based on graph-based deep learning, which is able to directly process networks of servers and flows. Via a numerical evaluation, we show that our proposed heuristic is able to accurately predict which analysis method will produce the tightest delay bound. We also demonstrate that the computational cost of our heuristic makes it of practical use, with average runtimes one or two order of magnitude faster than traditional analysis methods.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We consider the migration of virtualized services (VSs) in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), so as to facilitate server maintenance, load balancing under mobility, improved energy efficiency and resource utilization, and incident response. We consider a set of VSs that has to be migrated from a source placement to a target placement, while maintaining service continuity as much as possible. We formulate the VS migration problem as an integer programming problem, and analyze its complexity. We propose an efficient iterative algorithm for computing when and in what order the VSs shall be migrated among the MEC nodes. We evaluate the proposed solution in terms of total service value, efficiency, and scalability. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm is computationally effective, and performs close to optimal.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> One-way delay (OWD) between end hosts has important implications for Internet applications, protocols, and measurement-based analyses. We describe a new approach for identifying OWDs via passive measurement of Network Time Protocol (NTP) traffic. NTP traffic offers the opportunity to measure OWDs accurately and continuously from hosts throughout the Internet. Based on detailed examination of NTP implementations and in-situ behavior, we develop an analysis tool that we call TimeWeaver, which enables assessment of precision and accuracy of OWD measurements from NTP. We apply TimeWeaver to a âˆ¼1TB corpus of NTP traffic collected from 19 servers located in the US and report on the characteristics of hosts and their associated OWDs, which we classify in a precision/accuracy hierarchy. To demonstrate the utility of these measurements, we apply iterative hard-threshold singular value decomposition to estimate OWDs between arbitrary hosts from the highest tier in the hierarchy. We show that this approach results in highly accurate estimates of OWDs, with average error rates on the order of less than 2%.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> WhatsAnalyzer is a web-based service, which collects and analyzes chat histories of the mobile messaging application WhatsApp. Thereby, it leverages the e-mail export feature of WhatsApp to obtain the chat histories, which cannot be accessed otherwise due to encrypted storage on the mobile device and end-to-end encrypted transmission over the Internet. Thus, the major asset of the service is that real communication data can be collected without the bias introduced by observing or surveying participants. The collected communication data can be analyzed and provides valuable insights into the communication in WhatsApp and the resulting network traffic. To incentivize users to send chat histories, the privacy of users is respected by anonymizing all communication data. Moreover, some analyses of each chat history can be accessed on a web page by the sender of the chats.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> A data center can be modeled as a set of parallel queues, and the dispatcher decides to which queue the arriving jobs are routed. We consider an energy-aware dispatching system in a Markovian setting, where each server upon becoming empty enters a sleep mode to save energy and to activate the server after sleep incurs an additional setup delay cost. We seek to optimize the performance-energy trade-off by applying the so-called Whittle index approach. As our main result, we rigorously prove, under a certain technical assumption, that the problem is indexable, and derive the explicit form of the Whittle index. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the resulting energy-aware Whittle index policy is able to perform very close to the numerically obtained optimal policy.
