    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The parallel execution of requests in a Cloud Computing platform, as for Virtualized Network Functions, is modeled by an M^[X]/M/1 Processor-Sharing (PS) system, where each request is seen as a batch of unit jobs. The performance of such paralleled system can then be measured by the quantiles of the batch sojourn time distribution. In this paper, we address the evaluation of this distribution for the M^[X]/M/1-PS queue with batch arrivals and geometrically distributed batch size. General results on the residual busy period (after a tagged batch arrival time) and the number of unit jobs served during this residual busy period are first derived. This enables us to provide an approximation for the distribution tail of the batch sojourn time whose accuracy is confirmed by simulation.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We consider server systems with constant interarrival times subject to arbitrary cost functions. This type of systems arise when we have full control over arrivals. Typical examples includes situations where computers or network elements schedule periodic updates at regular time intervals (cf. cron daemon in unix systems, IoT, etc.), a congestion avoidance or load balancing mechanism imposes regular inter-arrival times at a lower level, and also in customer service and healthcare systems where patients book appointments. In the basic case, known as the D/M/1 queue, there is a single server and the service times are independent and exponentially distributed. We study different value functions for the D/M/1 queue that characterize the expected cost difference in the infinite time horizon if the system is initially in state $n$ instead of being in equilibrium. When the arrival process is Poisson, the corresponding results are compact and known. The fixed interarrival times complicate the situation, and even the mean waiting time is harder to characterize. We apply our results to develop a heuristic for a dispatching problem, and evaluate the heuristic numerically.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Opportunistic communications are expected to play a crucial role in vehicular services that are based on location and require extremely low latency.
A widely investigated opportunistic communication paradigm for the local dissemination of contextualized information is Floating Content (FC), which tries to make content float over a geographical area by replicating it whenever two users meet.
The key Quality of Service (QoS) indicator for FC is \em content availability, defined as the fraction of users that received the information that is supposed to float.
Optimizing the use of FC resources while meeting the availability target QoS is a highly complex issue. Fully distributed, distance-based approaches proved to be highly inefficient, and may not meet the target QoS. Centralized, model-based approaches do not perform well in realistic inhomogeneous settings. In this work, we present a data-driven centralized approach to resource-efficient, QoS-aware dynamic management of FC. We propose a Deep Learning strategy for FC operation, which employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture the relations between the patterns of users mobility, the patterns of content diffusion and replication, and the performance of FC in terms of resource efficiency and availability within a given Zone of Interest (ZOI).
Numerical evaluations show the effectiveness of our approach, as well as the capability of our approach to adapt to mobility pattern changes over time.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have become more and more popular and widespread during recent years. After the initial hype about the technology and many cryptocurrency related use cases, the technology slowly starts to make its way into other domains like food tracking and document management. In order to further contribute to the search of what this technology can be used for, more detailed performance evaluations are required in order to investigate key performance indicators and general limits of the technology. To this end, we develop a discrete-time queueing model that allows a detailed evaluation of the characteristics of a blockchain system, such as the transaction waiting time distribution. Furthermore, we validate the model by comparing the results to values obtained from measurements in a closed lab environment based on the Ethereum blockchain.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Network Functions Virtualization is gaining significant attention from researchers for reducing the costs of Telecommunication Service Providers (TSP) and giving more flexibility to market demands. Traditionally, works dealing with virtual network function placement and chaining problem receive the requests with a fixed chaining composition. In an online environment with substrate network resources partially consumed, such fixed chaining composition, although being optimal for the client, may be less profitable or impossible to be mapped by the service provider. In this case, an alternative chain composition, even with eventually higher bandwidth expenditure, may potentially have a better adjustment on the residual substrate network. This work proposes to give more autonomy to the TSP through a set of alternative chaining compositions. Such action includes flexibility in the choice of the structure that best fits on the residual network. In this model, the client is responsible to provide chaining alternatives (attending the same network service) to the TSP. The simulations show that the composition selection approach generates increases in profit and acceptance rate when compared to traditional models.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we study the fluctuations of the transient and stationary empirical distributions around the mean-field for a large scale multi-server Erlang Loss system that has $N$ servers. Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $Nłambda$ and each incoming job is dispatched by a central job dispatcher to the server with the minimum occupancy among $d$ randomly chosen servers with ties broken uniformly at random. Previous works have studied the mean-field limit of this model and characterized the asymptotic behavior of the system when $N\toınfty$. In this paper, we focus on quantifying the resulting error when we approximate the transient and stationary behavior of the system when $N$ is large by the mean-field of the system. We obtain functional central limit theorems (FCLTs) by studying the limit of a suitably scaled fluctuation process of the stochastic empirical process of the model with index $N$ around the mean-field limit when $N\toınfty$. We show that for both the transient and stationary regimes, the limiting process is characterized by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. We also show that the interchange of limits $łim_N\toınftyłim_t\toınfty=łim_t\toınftyłim_N\toınfty$ is valid under the CLT scaling. Finally, we exploit the FCLT to show that the gap between the exact average blocking probability of a job in the system with the number of servers $N$ and the limiting average blocking probability which is a function of the fixed-point of the mean-field, is of the order $o(N^-\frac12)$ and thus establish the accuracy of the mean-field approximation for finite $N$.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Fuelled by the proliferation of smartphones, wireless traffic has experienced huge growth, which will continue and exacerbate the capacity strain in cellular networks. Network densification has emerged as a powerful paradigm to boost spectral efficiency and accommodate the continual rise in demand for wireless capacity. These dense networks also make resource allocation more challenging though, as they result in more irregular cells with possibly overlapping coverage
areas and greater variability in traffic loads. To deal with these load imbalances, there are typically two methods to dynamically match capacity and demand: ``bring users to capacity'' (user association) and ``bring capacity to the users'' (frequency/spectrum allocation).

In this paper we study the joint operation of load-aware dynamic user association and frequency allocation algorithms in dense cellular networks. Motivated by a joint load-balancing optimization problem, we consider load-aware algorithms that operate using load measurements at the access points (APs) and can react to changing load conditions without knowledge of difficult-to-obtain system parameters. We present extensive simulation results for various parameter settings, allowing for the user association and frequency allocation algorithms to operate on different time scales. The simulation results show that the joint operation of these algorithms leads to excellent performance without the need to provide an initialized and optimized frequency allocation.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The performance of different combinations of user
association (UA) and resource allocation (RA) in heterogeneous
cellular networks has been extensively studied using a classic
modeling approach based on system snapshots. There have been
also many studies focusing on the dynamics of the system
using queueing models. These modeling approaches are rarely
compared with each other though they each bring different
insights to the design problem. In this paper, we consider a
queueing model-based approach to study the interplay of UA and
RA, and compare the results to those obtained using snapshot
models. Specifically, we formulate three different joint UA and
RA optimization problems corresponding to the following three
performance metrics: the maximum achievable arrival rate, the
average system delay, and the maximum per-user delay. These
problems are non-convex integer programs. We have therefore
developed numerical techniques to compute either their exact
solutions or tight lower bounds. We obtain results for different
combinations of RA and UA schemes, and compare the trends
with those obtained via the snapshot approach. The trends on
RA are very similar, which we take as a cross-validation of the
two modeling approaches for this kind of problem. The trends on
user association are somewhat different which indicates a lack
of robustness of the results and the need for a careful validation
of UA models.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We consider a wireless network of $N$ base stations(BSs) serving $M$ users through time-varying channels. The service rate provided by the channel is observed only when the corresponding BS is switched on. In this setup, we consider two types of costs: $(1)$the cost of maintaining BS in on state, $(2)$the cost of switching the state of BS(from on to off or from off to on). In this paper, we propose an algorithm which achieves cost arbitrarily close to the optimum cost under queue stability. Since traditional Drift-plus-Penalty approach does not suffice to achieve this, we propose proof in two steps. In the first step, we show the BS running cost arbitrarily close to the optimum under queue stability. In the second step, we show the mean number of BS switch-overs is of the order $O(1/U)$. We illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms via simulations.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> An accurate and fast estimation of the available bandwidth in a network with varying cross traffic is a challenging task. The accepted probing tools, based on the fluid-flow model of a bottleneck link with first-in-first-out multiplexing, estimate
the available bandwidth by measuring packet dispersions. The estimation becomes more difficult if the packet dispersions deviate from the assumptions of the fluid-flow model in the presence of non-fluid bursty cross traffic, multiple bottleneck
links, and inaccurate time-stamping. This motivates us to explore the use of machine learning tools for available bandwidth estimation. Hence, we consider reinforcement learning and implement the single state multi-armed bandit technique, which
follows the ε-greedy algorithm to find the available bandwidth. Our measurements and tests reveal that our proposed method identifies the available bandwidth with high precision. Furthermore, our method converges to the available bandwidth under a variety of notoriously difficult conditions such as heavy traffic burstiness, different cross traffic intensities, multiple bottleneck links, and in networks where tight link differs from bottleneck link. Compared to the piecewise linear network model-based direct technique that employs Kalman filter, our method shows accurate and faster convergence in many certain network scenarios and does not require measurement noise statistics.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is the de-facto standard for video delivery over the Internet. Video clips are split into segments and the quality can dynamically be adapted by choosing between multiple quality levels per segment.
Based on client-centric parameters like the video buffer state or the throughput, an adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm decides the quality of the segments.
Besides the applied ABR algorithm, a multitude of parameters influence the Quality-of-Experience (QoE) like network and video characteristics, buffer thresholds, number of provided quality levels, and segment durations. This results in a highly complex interaction between the different system parameters.

However, the interdependence of these parameters has not been explored in a holistic manner, yet. In this paper, a generic performance model for throughput-based and buffer based ABR algorithms is proposed. Using discrete-time analysis, the model allows to compute relevant HAS metrics such as video interruptions and play back quality.
To highlight the practical applicability of the model, an extensive evaluation is presented, in which the probabilistic model's results are compared with actual measurements of simplistic buffer-based and rate-based ABR algorithms. The results indicate that the model is sufficiently expressive to model the behavior in various settings, while still remaining computationally tractable.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we propose a contention mechanism based on the execution of multiple contention rounds in the frequency domain (ReCHo), which results very robust to imperfect carrier sensing. The main idea is using narrow tones as signalling messages for performing channel access contentions and allowing the Access Point to echo these signals, in order to extend the sensing capabilities of all the stations. In particular, we refer to the emerging IEEE 802.11ax standard, showing how our scheme can boost performance of random access with respect to the current version of IEEE 802.11ax OFDMA Back-Off (OBO), even when hidden node probability is very high.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We provide a flow level analysis of the offloading capability of D2D technology when devices endowed by caches are moving in the network, within the cell and among cells. We introduce the mobility with respect to the receiving user when we consider D2D communication and with respect to the base station when we consider the classical cellular communication. Due to mobility, the quality of both D2D and cellular communication may change over time which makes the analysis challenging. We describe the system through an exact Markovian model, however, since it does not scale with the number of admissible users we provide a closed form approximation model based on multi-class Processor Sharing queue. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our approximation and show that mobility provides high capacity gains and a large offloading potential of D2D when devices are equipped with caches.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop a partial sharing model for providers described as a multi
server system. This is a generalisation of the full pooling that
have been studied in the literature. Partial sharing allows
providers to possibly pool a fraction of their resources when full
pooling is not beneficial to them. Two M/M/N queues with redundant
service models are considered. Copies of an arriving job are placed
in the queues of servers that can serve the job. Partial sharing
models for cancel-on-complete and cancel-on-start redundancy models
are developed. For cancel-on-complete, it is shown that the Pareto
efficient region is the full pooling configuration. For a
cancel-on-start policy, we conjecture that the Pareto frontier is
always non-empty and is such that at least one of the two providers
is sharing all of its resources. For this system, using bargaining
theory the sharing configuration that the providers may use is
determined. Mean response time and probability of waiting are the
performance metrics considered.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine Learning (ML) has shown its capability to analyse, classify, and make predictions based on, large data sets, amongst others by means of decision trees. Network performance analysis and evaluation, on the other hand, focuses on finding and expressing qualitative, quantitative and preferably formal relationships between performance parameters. Due to the potential complexity of the latter, approximations that highlight main contributions and their orders of magnitude are of specific interest. Thereby, different parameter sub-spaces may imply different kinds of dependencies, sensitivities and approximation formulae, e.g. saturation, asymptotic and disruptive behaviours. Given such challenges, this work demonstrates the ability of the ML algorithm M5P to perform performance analytics by identifying approximations, together the applicable parameter sub-spaces, in a robust one-strike approach. where the detailed investigation of the obtained model trees provides valuable insights. We present, investigate and discuss a set of examples, spanning from impacts of parameters on user ratings, via modelling of user ratings over time, to post-analysis of analytically obtained performance results for approximations and asymptotic behaviour.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Heterogeneity in wireless network architectures (i.e., the coexistence of 3G, LTE, 5G, WiFi, etc.) has become a key component of current and future generation cellular networks. Simultaneous aggregation of each client's traffic across multiple such radio access technologies (RATs) / base stations (BSs) can significantly increase the system throughput, and has become an important feature of cellular standards on multi-RAT integration. Distributed algorithms that can realize the full potential of this aggregation are thus of great importance to operators. In this paper, we study the problem of resource allocation for multi-RAT traffic aggregation in HetNets (heterogeneous networks). Our goal is to ensure that the resources at each BS are allocated so that the aggregate throughput achieved by each client across its RATs satisfies a proportional fairness (PF) criterion. In particular, we provide a simple distributed algorithm for resource allocation at each BS that extends the PF allocation algorithm for a single BS. Despite its simplicity and lack of coordination across the BSs, we show that our algorithm converges to the desired PF solution and provide (tight) bounds on its convergence speed. We also study the characteristics of the optimal solution and use its properties to prove the optimality of our algorithm's outcomes.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Migrating virtualized services (VSs) in mobile edge clouds is essential for maintaining service quality under mobility, for optimizing resource utilization, and for responding to incidents. We consider migrating VSs with heterogeneous resource requirements from a source placement to a target placement under a time constraint, while maintaining service continuity as much as possible. We formulate the VS migration problem as an integer programming problem, and propose an efficient algorithm to compute sequences of migration actions. The algorithm is based on a graphical representation of the VS dependencies, and constructs a collection of acyclic directed hypergraphs with bounded length. We evaluate our algorithm in realistic scenarios and compare it to the optimal solution and to a baseline algorithm. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, and is computationally efficient and scalable.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The limited power requirements of new generations of base stations make the use of renewable energy sources, solar in particular, extremely attractive for mobile network operators. Exploiting solar energy implies a reduction of the network operation cost as well as of the carbon footprint of radio access networks, but previous research works indicate that the area of the solar panels that are necessary to power a standard macro BS is large, so large to make the solar panel deployment problematic, especially within urban areas.
In this paper we use a modeling approach based on Markov reward processes to investigate the possibility of combining small area solar panels with a connection to the power grid to run a macro base station. By so doing, it is possible to increase the amount of renewable energy used to run a radio access network, while also reducing the cost incurred by the network operator to power its base stations.
We assume that energy is drawn from the power grid only when needed to keep the BS operational, or during the night, that corresponds to the period with lowest electricity price. This has advantages in terms of both cost and carbon footprint. We show that solar panels of the order of 1-2 kW peak, i.e., with a surface of about 5-10 m 2 , combined with limited capacity energy storage (of the order of 10-15 kWh, corresponding to about 3-5 car batteries), and a smart energy management policy, can lead to an effective exploitation of renewable energy.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We analyze the effect of sponsored data platforms when Internet
service providers (ISPs) compete for subscribers and content
providers (CPs) compete for a share of the bandwidth usage by the
customers. Our analytical model is of a full information,
leader-follower game. ISPs lead and set prices for sponsorship. CPs
then make the binary decision of sponsoring or not sponsoring their
content on the ISPs. Lastly, based on both of these, users make a
two-part decision of choosing the ISP to which they subscribe, and
the amount of data to consume from each of the CPs through the
chosen ISP. User consumption is determined by a utility maximization
framework, the sponsorship decision is determined by a
non-cooperative game between the CPs, and the ISPs set their prices
to maximize their profit in response to the prices set by the
competing ISP. We analyze the pricing dynamics of the prices set by
the ISPs, the sponsorship decisions that the CPs make and the market
structure therein, and the surpluses of the ISPs, CPs, and users.
We show that inter-ISP competition does not inhibit ISPs from
extracting a significant fraction of the CP surplus. Moreover, the
ISPs often have an incentive to significantly skew the CP
marketplace in favor of the most profitable CP.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Today a diverse crowdsourcing economy has established, and similar to other service industries, SLAs are a crucial part of this ecosystem. However, the uncertainty introduced by human workers makes it harder to estimate and set completion time guarantees than in a system that is solely technology based. In this work, we, therefore, analyze an exemplary task scheduling strategy that enables operators of crowdsourcing-based services to meet completion time SLAs. In particular, we use the real-world crowdsourcing-based text digitalization platform ScaleHub as the foundation for our system model and a dataset provided by ScaleHub to obtain a realistic parametrization of the model. We derive an analytical model that enables us to illustrate the potential of scheduling mechanisms to meet SLA constraints and that helps platform providers to optimize their systems. Further, we use a more detailed simulation model to illustrate the challenges arising from erroneous worker submission in the context of task schedulers.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Cooperative vehicle safety (CVS) systems are a key application of intelligent transportation systems because they include many applications, such as cooperative collision warning. In CVS systems, vehicles periodically broadcast their information, e.g., position and speed. In this paper, we propose an optimization method for the broadcast rate in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) broadcast communications at an intersection on the basis of theoretical analysis. We consider a model in which locations of vehicles are modeled separately as queuing and running segments and derive key performance metrics of V2V broadcast communications via a stochastic geometry approach. Since these theoretical expressions are mathematically intractable, we develop closed-form approximate formulae for them. Using them, we optimize the broadcast rate such that the mean number of successful receivers per unit time is maximized. Because of the closed form approximation, the optimal rate can be used as a guideline for a real-time control-method. We evaluated our method through numerical examples and demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.
