    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent years have seen an uprise in the development of middleboxes

functionalities (CGNATs, proxies, accelerators, etc), participating so in the

ossification of the Internet. In parallel, various solutions have been

developed to detect or circumvent unwanted middleboxes interferences such as

UDP-based middlebox-proof transports (Google's QUIC, PLUS), middlebox-proof

extensions to TCP (HICCUPS, TCPcrypt) and middlebox traversal mechanisms (STUN,

ICE, PLUS).

All those solutions make the assumption of ubiquitous middleboxes. However, a

view of the actual middleboxes deployment in the wild, in IPv4 wired networks,

is missing. In particular, knowing how autonomous systems (ASes) deploy

middleboxes in terms of prevalence and persistence would provide additional

relevant information to Internet topology models. In this paper, we aim at

filling this gap. Based on a large-scale measurement campaign, we highlight

different characteristics of middlebox deployment within ASes to elicit

middleboxes profiles.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Video traffic is a key-challenge for fixed and mobile operators facing variable and massive load and variety of Over-The-Top videos. Energy consumption is also a heavy component of the Opex and a promising solution is the Fixed-Mobile Convergence concept, which builds on economical optic fibers and deports and consolidates LTE base-band operations.

By combining FIA principles such as ubiquitous caching, SDN and NFV, and FMC, we propose a complete, fully dynamic setup which optimizes both for power consumption and QoE, by choosing proper infrastructure (turning on a minimum number of computing and networking equipments) and operational (routing and caching) configurations.

Our control plane named ViRCA is scalable thanks to data analytics techniques, and fully reactive to the dynamics of load and catalog both in time and space.

Numerical assessments in realistic settings show power gains of up to 30% while the scores on different QoE metrics are maximized. Enabling elastic co-location of caches and radio base-band operations turns out to be crucial for both power and QoE objectives.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) paradigm offers network operators benefits in terms of cost efficiency, vendor independence, as well as flexibility and scalability. However, in order to profit most from these features, new challenges in the area of management and orchestration of the virtual network functions (VNFs) need to be addressed. 

In particular, this work deals with the VNF chain placement problem (VNFCP). For a given network situation, the task consists of determining the number, location, and assignment of VNF instances and the routing of demands. At the same time, several metrics like CPU utilization and the delay of individual flows need to be taken into account. For applicability in networks with dynamically changing conditions, algorithms need to explore the solution space of this NP-hard problem in a timely manner.

The contribution of this work is threefold: firstly, we design MO-VNFCP, a multi-objective heuristic for the VNFCP. Secondly, we investigate the convergence behavior of the algorithm in a case study. Finally, we provide a comparison between the proposed algorithm and an alternative approach from literature.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Bio-inspired paradigms are proving to be useful in analysing propagation and dissemination of information in networks. In this paper we explore the use of multi-type branching processes to analyse viral properties of content in a social network, with and without competition from other sources. We derive and compute various virality measures, e.g., probability of virality, expected number of shares, or the rate of growth of expected number of shares etc. They allow one to predict the emergence of global macro properties (e.g., viral spread of a post in the entire network) from the laws and parameters that determine local interactions. The local interactions, greatly depend upon the structure of the time- lines holding the content and the number of friends (i.e., connections) of users of the network. We then formulate a non-cooperative game problem and study the Nash equilibria as a function of the parameters. The branching processes modelling the social network under competition turn out to be decomposable, multi-type and continuous time variants. For such processes types belonging to different sub-classes evolve at different rates and have different probabilities of extinction etc. We compute content provider wise extinction probability, rate of growth etc. We also conjecture the content-provider wise growth rate of expected shares.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Beaconing is a basic communication process taking place in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) to achieve cooperative awareness among vehicles on the road. It is actually a paradigm of information spreading among peer-agents, where each node of a networks sends periodically broadcast messages containing information collected by the node itself. A trade-off arises between the update frequency of the broadcast information and the congestion induced in the wireless shared channel used to send the messages, which is based on the IEEE 802.11p standard in case of a VANET. For periodic updates, the primary metric is the Age-of-Information (AoI), i.e., the age of the latest update received by neighboring nodes. We define an analytical model to evaluate the AoI of a VANET, given the connectivity graph of the vehicles. Analytical results are compared to simulation to assess the accuracy of the model. The model provides a handy tool to optimize the AoI trade-off.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Traffic classification, i.e. associating network traffic to the application that generated it, is an important tool for several tasks, spanning on different fields (security, management, traffic engineering, R&D). This process is challenged by applications that preserve Internet users' privacy by encrypting the communication content, and even more by anonymity tools, additionally hiding the source, the destination, and the nature of the communication. In this paper, leveraging a public data set released in 2017, we provide classification results with the aim of investigating to what degree the specific anonymity tool (and the traffic it hides) can be identified, when compared to the traffic of the other considered anonymity tools, using machine learning approaches based on the sole statistical features. To this end, four classifiers are trained and tested on the dataset: (i) Naive Bayes, (ii) Bayesian Network, (iii) C4.5, and (iv) Random Forests. Results show that the three anonymity tools (Tor, I2P, JonDonym) can be easily distinguished (accuracy 99.99%), and even the specific kind of traffic they carry (e.g., web browsing, chat, video, etc.) can be inferred (accuracy 98.25%). By providing an in-depth analysis of the aforementioned dataset and a detailed description of the present study, we foster repeatability and further research on anonymity tools traffic classification.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Virtualization paradigms like cloud computing, software defined networking (SDN), and network functions virtualization (NFV) provide advantages with respect to aspects like flexibility, costs, and scalability. However, management and orchestration of the resulting networks also introduce new challenges. The placement of services, such as virtual machines̃(VMs), virtualized network functions\̃(VNFs), or SDN controllers, is a multi-objective optimization task that confronts operators with a multitude of possible solutions that are incomparable among each other. The goal of this work is to investigate mechanisms that enable automated decision making between such multi-dimensional solutions. To this end, we investigate techniques from the domain of multi-attribute decision making that aggregate the performance of placements to a single numeric score. A comparison between resulting rankings of placements shows that many techniques produce similar results. Hence, placements that achieve good rankings according to many approaches might be viable candidates in the context of automated decision making. In order to illustrate the functionality of the different scoring mechanisms, we perform a case study on a single network graph and a fixed number of objectives and service instances. Additionally, we present aggregated results from broad evaluations on the Internet Topology Zoo and a larger number of objectives as well as varying numbers of service instances. These allow making more reliable statements about the mechanisms' performance and agreement.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Several reasons make NFV an attractive paradigm for IT security: lowers costs, agile operations and better isolation as well as fast security updates, improved incident responses and better level of automation. At the same time, the network threats tend to be increasingly complex and distributed, implying huge traffic scale to be monitored and increasingly strict mitigation delay requirements. Considering the current trend of the networking and the requirements to counteract to the evolution of cyber-threats, it is expected that also network monitoring will move towards NFV based solutions. In this paper, we present Distributed StreaMon (D-StreaMon) an orchestration framework for distributed monitoring on NFV network architectures. D-StreaMon has been designed to face the above described challenges. It relies on the StreaMon platform, a solution for network monitoring originally designed for traditional middleboxes. Changes that allow Streamon to be deployed on NFV network architectures are described. The paper reports a performance evaluation of the realized NFV based solutions and discusses potential benefits in monitoring tenants' VMs for Service Providers.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Anticipatory networking is a recent branch of network optimization that exploits contextual information to improve resource allocation decisions based on prediction. While some anticipatory networking concepts have been proposed in the literature, understanding of the potential real world gains is so far very limited. Future mobile networks will likely integrate such mechanisms, and thus it is of paramount importance to understand the actual performance improvements and in which scenarios they can be realized.

Analyzing a month-worth of LTE control channel information collected in four urban locations, we show how anticipatory networking can enhance current LTE networks.

First, we propose a comprehensive optimization framework encompassing different forecasting solutions.

Then, we provide a thorough analysis of the aggregated network traffic and the contributions of individual users.

In particular, we show that predictable traffic accounts for more than 95% of the total traffic volume and that simple prediction and optimization techniques allow network operators to save 50% of the resources and/or increase the offered data rate by one order of magnitude on average in our data set.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we present a new adaptive multi-flow routing algorithm to select end-to-end paths in packet-switched networks. This algorithm provides provable optimality guarantees in the following game theoretic sense: The network configuration converges to a configuration arbitrarily close to a pure Nash equilibrium. In this context, a Nash equilibrium is a configuration in which no flow can improve its end-to-end delay by changing its network path.

This algorithm has several robustness properties making it suitable for real-life usage: it is robust to measurement errors, outdated information, and clocks desynchronization. Furthermore, it is only based on local information and only takes local decisions, making it suitable for a distributed implementation.

Our SDN-based proof-of-concept is built as an Openflow controller. We set up an emulation platform based on Mininet to test the behavior of our proof-of-concept implementation in several scenarios. Although real-world conditions do not conform exactly to the theoretical model, all experiments exhibit satisfying behavior, in accordance with the theoretical predictions.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Data centers consume substantial amounts of energy. Server clusters, being an integral part of data centers, take the largest share. Load balancing policies in server clusters have historically been optimized for performance or simplicity. However, the choice of load balancing policy, together with the power provisioning policy, can greatly impact energy efficiency of a server cluster. In this paper we consider the two widely deployed load balancing policies: the Round-Robin (RR) and Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ) policies, and compare their performance and energy consumption to a simple modification of JSQ (Pack-JSQ). Using mean response time and mean power consumption as metrics, we study these three policies via simulation runs by using publicly available Wikipedia request traces. We show that Pack-JSQ gives superior energy efficiency without compromising performance when deployed with a simple power provisioning policy that controls the number of running servers based on request arrival rate information.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The consolidation of resources is one of the most efficient strategies to reduce the power consumption in data centers. Various algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce the total number of required servers and network devices. The practice developed in response to the problem of server sprawl, a situation in which multiple, under-utilized servers (and/or network devices) take up more space and consume more resources than can be justified by their workload; with the effect to power off unused equipment. Generally, consolidation mechanisms consider different parameters related to the services neglecting the specific function of the Virtual Machines (VMs) in the application framework (e.g., core component, backup replica, member of a set of workers for load balancing).
		
		In this work, we developed a new consolidation algorithm that takes into account the particular function of each VM with the aim to apply power saving mechanisms without compromising the desired service level. The results of the simulations show that it is possible to obtain significant values of energy saving. In particular, we show, with different heuristics, the optimal tradeoff between service level and power efficiency achieved by the proposed model.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing topic of interest along with 5G. Billions of IoT devices are expected to connect to the Internet in the near future. These devices differ from the traditional devices operated in the Internet. We observe that Information Centric Networking (ICN), is a more suitable	architecture for the IoT compared to the prevailing IP based network. However, we observe that recent works that propose to	use ICN for IoT, either do not cover the need to integrate Sensor Networks with the Internet to realize IoT or do so inefficiently.	Fog computing is a promising technology that has many benefits to offer especially for IoT. We discover a need to integrate various	heterogeneous Sensor Networks with the Internet to realize IoT.	In this work, we propose FOGG:A Fog Computing Based Gateway	to Integrate Sensor Networks to Internet. FOGG uses a edge device to function as IoT gateway. FOGG provides the needed integration along with additional services like name/protocol translation, security and controller functionalities.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Video streaming has established itself as the main method to consume multimedia content on the Internet. The most widespread technique is HTTP Adaptive Streaming which is used by large video service platforms such as YouTube and Netflix. In order to guarantee a high QoE, different adaptation strategies have been developed that lead to different video playout patterns. While some strategies may be more aggressive than others and often adapt the video quality, it is not clear which strategy is the best.
		
		In this paper, we want to identify the trade-off between the average video quality and switches in the quality during playout. We do this with a user-centric view and try to optimize the adaptation depending on the user preference with a quadratic program. This work allows to put existing and future video adaptation algorithms in perspective with respect to user preferences. Our results show that the video quality can already be increased greatly by allowing few switches while more switches lead to diminishing gains. This is a novel discovery that is important for user-centric QoE-management which is of high interest for ISPs and video service providers.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) separates classical IP addresses into two categories: one for identifying terminals, the other for routing. To associate identifiers and locators LISP needs a specific mechanism, called mapping system. This technology is still at an early stage but two experimental platforms have already been deployed in the Internet: LISP Beta Network and LISP-Lab. However, only the LISP Beta Network is monitored with LISPmon that partially monitors the mapping system once a day. To accompany the growth of LISP, a dynamic and complete monitoring system is required. Therefore, we propose LISP-Views, a dynamic versatile large scale LISP monitoring architecture. LISPViews allows to automatically conduct comprehensive and objective measurements. After running LISP-Views in the wild for several months and comparing the monitoring results with LISPmon, we confirm that LISP-Views provides more detailed and accurate information. We observe the different behaviours between every network entity within mapping system, and also explore the current LISP performance for further improvements.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we study the use of redundancy to reduce latency and increase reliability in communication networks. The work is motivated in particular by wireless networks, where channels may be unreliable and channel characteristics may vary over time. The objective is to provide an analysis of the gains achievable through the use of redundant messages. Redundancy increases the network load and hence the delay of each packet, but can reduce overall delay by exploiting independent randomness across multiple paths. One of the goals addressed in this paper is the optimisation of this trade-off. We consider both average delay minimisation and probabilistic guarantees on delay exceeding some tolerance threshold. We study a number of different stochastic models for packet transmission times, and uses techniques from queueing theory and large deviations to analyse their performance. The analytical results are complemented by simulations.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Fuelled by the proliferation of smartphones, wireless traffic has experienced huge growth, which will continue with the emergence of ultra-broadband 5G applications, and exacerbate the capacity strain in cellular networks. Deployment of pico access points, reducing cell sizes and allowing more efficient reuse of limited radio spectrum, provides a powerful approach to cope with traffic hot spots and bring capacity relief. This network densification makes cell planning more challenging though, and tends to result in more irregular cells with possibly overlapping coverage areas and greater variability in traffic loads. This raises a critical need for more intelligent cell selection algorithms, which not only take signal strength values into account, but also load conditions in order to harness the full potential of the pico-cells.

In the present paper we analyse online cell selection algorithms that use a parsimonious set of load-driven control parameters to determine an optimal user association in a measurement-based manner, without requiring explicit knowledge of the system parameters. We exploit stochastic approximation techniques to establish the convergence of the control parameters to the optimal values. Extensive simulation experiments for scenarios with many pico access points confirm that the algorithms are quite effective in optimally balancing the traffic loads in hot spot areas, and further demonstrate that they substantially outperform conventional approaches in terms of service denials and low throughput percentiles. We consider several implementation options and evaluate the relative benefits and potential trade-offs.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper we consider an LTE macrocell where cellular users can be selected to act in Device-to-Device (D2D) mode to optimise spectrum efficiency and resource utilisation. We propose a D2D mode selection method based on a Mixed Integer Linear Program, accounting for the signal-to-noise ratio among nodes and the user sociality. This work analyses the benefit of D2D considering also interference and evaluating whether it is better to assign uplink or downlink radio resources for the D2D communication. Simulations show improvements in terms of network throughput, with respect to a case where D2D links are not used, even accounting for interference and considering half-duplex communication. It is also shown how the choice of a well designed radio resource assignment strategy has a strong impact on the interference created in the network by the activation of D2D links.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we study a model for cloud systems consisting of $N$ heterogeneous parallel servers of finite capacities, where jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate \$Nłambda\$ and each arriving job is routed to the server with the maximum vacancy amongst $d$ randomly selected servers. The performance of the above routing scheme, known as the Power-of-$d$ routing scheme, has previously been analyzed for such systems but only under the assumption of exponential holding times of the jobs at the servers. However, in most realistic applications, the assumption of exponential holding times does not hold and therefore it is of importance to understand the performance of the power-of-$d$ routing scheme under more general holding time distributions. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of the system under mixed-Erlang service time distributions since any distribution on \$[0,$\backslash$infty)\$ can be approximated by the mixed-Erlang distribution with arbitrary accuracy. We focus on the limiting regime where \$N $\backslash$to $\backslash$infty\$. This leads to a mean-field dynamics, that are significantly more difficult to analyze than the exponential case since the state of each server now becomes multi-dimensional. We derive the mean field dynamics of the system and show that the mean field has a unique fixed point that corresponds to the fixed point obtained with exponential assumptions on the holding times showing that the fixed point is insensitive to the parameters of the mixed-Erlang distribution and only depends on the mean.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent developments induced by the Internet of Things (IoT) force a paradigm shift to deploy on demand services to a broad range of different computing architectures. Mainly single board computers (SBCs) gained a lot of attraction in recent years, shifting highly available processing power to service consumers and IoT devices. Simultaneously, container virtualization achieved a breakthrough by the well known Docker environment that became a key competitor to the utilization of virtual machines. Nevertheless, spreading containers at small scale needs a proper allocation of resources available on SBCs.

As a first step, we developed a multi-architecture framework \dqPyMon\dq to monitor different computing architectures with a small footprint. PyMon itself is based on the recent version of \dqmonit\dq and a \dqDjango\dq application to collect monitoring data. It is delivered by several Docker images and allows monitoring with a reasonable processing overhead. Our demonstration shows the statistics of either processes or containers running on a cluster of SBCs, where each member is monitored. Furthermore, we evaluated the resource usage of the two key competitors for container cluster management on SBCs, Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, with PyMon.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> With the Internet applications become more complex and diverse, simple network traffic matrix estimation or approximation methods such as gravity model are no longer adequate. In this paper, we advocate a novel approach of approximating traffic matrices with multiple low-rank matrices. We build the theory behind the Multi-Low-Rank approximation and discuss the conditions under which it is better than Low-Rank SVD in terms of both matrix approximation and preserving the local (and global) structure of the traffic matrices. Further, we develop an effective technique based on spectral clustering of column/row feature vectors for decomposing traffic matrices into multiple low rank matrices. We perform a series of experiments on traffic matrices extracted from a synthetic dataset and two real world datasets -- one that represents nationwide cellular traffic and another taken from a tier-1 ISP. The results thus obtained show that Multi-Low-Rank approximation is superior for traffic classification; can be used to predict complete or missing entries of traffic matrices over time; show it's robustness against noise; and demonstrate that it closely follows the optimal solution (i.e., low-rank SVD solution).

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Mobile users in an urban environment access content on the internet from different locations. It is challenging for the current service providers to cope with the increasing demand from large number of collocated mobile users. In-network caching feature to offload content at nodes close to users alleviate the issue, though efficient cache management is required to find who should cache what, when and where in an urban environment, given nodes limited computing, communication and caching resources. To address this, we first define a novel relation between content popularity and availability in the network and investigate a node's eligibility to cache content based on its urban reachability. We then allow nodes to self-organize into mobile fogs to increase the distributed cache with the goal to maximize content availability in a cost-effective manner. However, to cater rational nodes, we propose a coalition game for the nodes to offer a maximum ``virtual cache\dq assuming a monetary reward is paid to them by the service/content provider. Nodes are allowed to merge into different spatio-temporal coalitions in order to increase the distributed cache size at the network edge. Results obtained through simulations using realistic urban mobility trace validate the performance of our caching system showing a ratio of 60-85% of cache hits compared to the 30-40% obtained by the existing schemes and 10% in case of no coalition.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies a cellular network, where base stations move according to traffic/service needs; coverage and capacity offered are adaptive to the time-spatial variations of user demand. In particular, we analyze the performance of a network, where a base station is carried by a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, sometimes also denoted as drone). The Unmanned Aerial Base Station (UABS) flies over an urban area, offering coverage and capacity to users that are not served by the Terrestrial Base Stations (TBSs); in our scenario we consider in particular video users with stringent requirements in terms of downlink throughput. The paper proposes an approach to design the trajectory of the drone, that accounts for the actual position of users that are unsatisfied by the TBSs. The approach is based on the identification of clusters made of nearby users to be served, and a simple Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The potential improvements in terms of network capacity (sum throughput) and user satisfaction are estimated, in a scenario where the UABS uses a separate band with respect to the TBSs. This performance increase can be seen as an upper bound to the improvements that would be achieved by using the same band, where the UABS would actually interfere with the TBSs.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Route selection based on performance measurements is an essential task in inter-domain Traffic Engineering. It benefits from the detection of significant changes in RTT measurements and the understanding on potential causes of change. Among the large body of literature on change detection methods and their application in various domains, few works focus on RTT measurements. It is thus unclear which approach works best on such data. 

In this paper, we presented an evaluation framework for change detection on RTT times series, consisting of: 1) a carefully labelled 34,008-hour RTT dataset as ground truth; 2) a scoring method specifically tailored for RTT measurements. Furthermore, we proposed a data transformation that improves the detection performance of existing methods.

Path changes are as well attended to. We fixed shortcomings of previous works by distinguishing path changes due to routing protocols (IGP and BGP) from those caused by load balancing.

Finally, we applied our change detection methods to a large set of measurements from RIPE Atlas. The characteristics of both RTT and path changes were analyzed; the interplay between the two were also revealed. We identified extremely frequent AS path changes yet with few consequences on RTT, which has not been reported before.

The codes for data collection, change detection and evaluation, along with our labelled dataset were made public under opensource license. Apart from reproducibility considerations, we hope that it facilitates and encourages further developments on change detection methods for networking.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Fog computing has been proposed to improve the cloud computing functionality by moving computation and storage resources closer to end-users, thus reducing end-to-end latency to make new personal services available. However, a number of issues need to be overcome in order to deploy this new technology, which include scalability of user localization and data migration, along with new ways of interactions among the involved stakeholders. In this respect, this paper proposes an intercommunication layer that allows to isolate the physical resources while managing the migration of service instances according to the user's position. Moreover, the introduction of specific mechanisms ensure personal services are deployed in a lightweight fashion. Test results will show how such mechanisms guarantee service migration to be seamless with downtimes reduced up to 3 orders of magnitude.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In the last years, recent advances in wireless communications and node processing capabilities together with the definition of new paradigms for network softwarization based on the adaption of cloud computing is evolving. With the 5th generation of mobile network enormous benefits for service providers as well as private persons arise. Scalability of services by segmentation into several components helps cloud providers to monitor and analyze their services. Services to be provided to the 5G network users are divided into independent components and instantiated in remote clouds or at the edge of the network. The service itself is composed of the components to a so-called service chain.
		
		To understand the performance, key influence factors are commonly examined for each component.
		
		To analyze these influence factors, analytical models by means of task graph reduction can be used. In this work, each component is described by a task graph node and a processing time distribution. Out of all nodes, a task graph is created and reduced receiving one probability density function characterizing a performance evaluation of the whole service chain. With the example of cloud based video streaming, video transmission on a 5G network is considered as use case and analyzed with a created tool.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Among the opportunistic content sharing services

proposed, Floating Content (FC) is of special interest for the

vehicular environment, not only for cellular traffic offloading,

but also as a natural communication paradigm for location-based

context-aware vehicular applications. Existing results on

the performance of vehicular FC have focused on content persistence,

without addressing the key issues of the effectiveness with which

content is replicated and made available, and of what are

the conditions which enable acceptable FC performance in the

vehicular environment. This work presents a first analytical

model of FC performance in vehicular ad-hoc networks in urban

settings. It is based on a variation of the random waypoint

(RWP) mobility model, and it does not require a model of

road grid geometry for its parametrization. We validate it

extensively through numerical simulations on real-world traces,

showing its accuracy on a variety of mobility patterns and traffic

conditions. Through simulations, we show the feasibility of

the FC paradigm in realistic urban settings over a wide range of traffic

conditions.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we investigate the provision of a new form of resilience, namely information resilience - targeting reliable communication of information under normal and adverse network conditions. We harness the power and flexibility of information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm where content are named and can be explicitly identified as opposed to the current host-centric Internet. Using ICN principles, we propose a new modularity-based information caching approach that leverages the concept of modularity such that information reachability and persistency are enhanced especially under perturbed network scenarios, e.g., network failures due to natural disasters or network under malicious attacks. The main idea of our proposal is to exploit the better connectivity of nodes within certain community construct in a network to provide higher information diversity, and thus allow potential access to a higher number of information objects even under various network dynamics. We conduct extensive simulations based on both real and model network topologies and show that our proposal can significantly increase request satisfaction ratios under highly dynamic network scenarios (i.e., network under multiple perturbations) across different system parameters.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Mobile edge caching will represent a 5G service able to improve the quality of experience of users served on mobile networks. Video streaming is the candidate traffic category which will leverage on such service. In turn, the availability of rate-adaptive video playout mechanisms on board of mobile terminals will improve the video-streaming experience and offer a novel dimension to optimize caching policies in a site-dependent fashion. In this paper we present new rate-aware caching schemes able to optimize the cache composition both versus popularity of video contents and the aggregated users' video rate demand. Several algorithms are proposed and compared against their rate-agnostic counterparts. Extensive numerical results provide evaluation of the relative advantage of this new class of caching policies.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> WebRTC is a promising standard for real-time communication in the browser. It supports transfer of delay sensitive real-time video and audio material using SRTP, as well as transfer of arbitrary data using SCTP. The congestion control algorithms of these two transport protocols are optimized for two different goals: While RTP tries to keep delays minimal, SCTP tries to maximize throughput. This contradiction leads to an excess in queuing delay and ultimately a deterioration of user experience when these protocols are used simultaneously. The work at hand introduces a novel algorithm for coupling the two transport protocols in order to achieve both goals at the same time. We have implemented our algorithm in the OMNeT++/INET simulation environment and present results to prove that the algorithm works as intended. We found that our approach keeps queuing delays in tolerable regions for all link configurations tested, enabling the concurrent use of WebRTC Media Channels and SCTP Data Channels independent of the queue length of the access router.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The performance of computer networks relies on how bandwidth is shared among different flows. Fair resource allocation is a challenging problem particularly when the flows evolve over time. To address this issue, bandwidth sharing techniques that quickly react to the traffic fluctuations are of interest, especially in large scale settings with hundreds of nodes and thousands of flows. In this context, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that tackles the fair resource allocation problem in a distributed SDN control architecture. Our algorithm continuously generates a sequence of resource allocation solutions converging to the fair allocation while always remaining feasible, a property that standard primal-dual decomposition methods often lack. Thanks to the distribution of all computer intensive operations, we demonstrate that we can handle large instances in real-time.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> When scheduling single server systems, Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) minimizes the number of jobs in the system at every point in time. However, a major

limitation of SRPT is that it requires job processing times a priori. In practice, it is likely that only estimates of job processing times are available. This paper proposes a policy that schedules jobs with estimated job processing times. The proposed Modified Comparison Splitting Scheduling (MCSS) policy is compared to SRPT when scheduling both single and multi-server systems. In the single server system we observe from simulations that the proposed scheduling policy provides robustness that is crucial for achieving good performance. In contrast, in a multi-server system we observe that robustness to estimation errors is not dependent on the scheduling policy. However, as the number of servers grows, SRPT becomes preferable.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper concerns the problem of estimating the Internet flow duration distribution from indirect measurements due to network constraints. The aim is to estimate the distribution from observing: the possible superpositions (collisions) of sampled flow durations, the flow arrivals-to-departures times without identification of sampled flows and the number of sampled flows in progress. For each type of data available, we present estimators of the flow duration distribution, formulating the problem in queueing system terms. We also propose data streaming algorithms using sampling and sketching (through counters) to obtain the considered partial information from flows. 

At the core of this skampling (i.e. sampling and sketching) approach is the ability to tune the flow sampling probability for \dqoptimal\dq flow load onto sketch entries (queues). Finally, we present numerical results comparing the different estimators of the flow duration distribution using two real Internet traces.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Mobile Broadband (MBB) Networks are evolving at a fast pace, with technology enhancements that promise drastic improvements in capacity, connectivity, coverage, i.e., better performance in general. 

But how to measure the actual performance of a MBB solution?

In this paper, we present our experience in running the simplest of the performance test: ``speedtest-like'' measurements to estimate the download speed offered by actual 3G/4G networks.

Despite their simplicity, download speed measurements in MBB networks are much more complex than in wired networks, because of additional factors (e.g., mobility of users, physical impairments, diversity in technology, operator settings, mobile terminals diversity, etc.).



We exploit the MONROE open platform, with hundreds of multihomed nodes scattered in 4 different countries, and explicitly designed with the goal of providing hardware and software solutions to run large scale experiments in MBB networks.

We analyze datasets collected in 4 countries, over 11 operators, from about 50 nodes, for more than one month.

After designing the experiment and instrumenting both the clients and the servers with active and passive monitoring tools, we dig into collected data, and provide insight to highlight the complexity of running even a simple speedtest.

Results show interesting facts, like the occasional presence of NAT, and of Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEP), and pinpoint the impact of different network configurations that further complicate the picture.

Our results will hopefully contribute to the debate about performance assessment in MBB networks, and to the definition of much needed benchmarks for performance comparisons of 3G, 4G and soon of 5G networks.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are aimed at analyzing and detecting security problems. IDS based on anomaly detection and, in particular, on statistical analysis, inspect each traffic flow in order to get its statistical characterization, which represents the fingerprint of the flow. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is revolutionizing the networking industry by enabling programmability, easier management and faster innovation. These benefits are made possible by its centralized control plane architecture which allows the network to be programmed and controlled by one central entity. The fusion of these two technologies can lead to an innovative system of malware detection. This paper tries to join these two concepts in order to obtain the best from the two worlds. We use a well known machine learning scheme (Support Vector Machine) as core system for detecting malware by using only traffic features that can be extracted using an SDN controller.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies are fundamental enablers to meet the objectives of 5G networks. In this work, we first introduce the architecture for dynamic deployment and composition of virtual functions proposed by the Superfluidity project. Then we consider a case study based on a typical 5G scenario. In particular, we detail the design and implementation of a Video Streaming service exploiting Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) functionalities. The analysis of the case study provide an assessment on what can be achieved with current technologies and gives a first confirmation of the validity of the proposed approach. Finally, we identify future directions of work towards the realization of a superfluid softwarized network.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Obtaining flow-level measurements, similar to those provided by Netflow/IPFIX, with OpenFlow is challenging as it requires the installation of an entry per flow in the flow tables. This approach does not scale well with the number of concurrent flows in the traffic as the number of entries in the flow tables is limited and small. Flow monitoring rules may also interfere with forwarding or other rules already present in the switches, which are often defined at different granularities than the flow level. In this paper, we present a transparent and scalable flow-based monitoring solution that is fully compatible with current off-the-shelf OpenFlow switches. As in NetFlow/IPFIX, we aggregate packets into flows directly in the switches and asynchronously send traffic reports to an external collector. In order to reduce the overhead, we implement two different traffic sampling methods depending on the OpenFlow features available in the switch. We developed our complete flow monitoring solution within OpenDaylight and evaluated its accuracy in a testbed with Open vSwitch. Our experimental results using real-world traffic traces show that the proposed sampling methods are accurate and can effectively reduce the resource requirements of flow measurements in OpenFlow.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We analyze the M^X/G/1 queue in the framework of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The service times become known upon arrival, and each job incurs a cost according to a given cost function. The value function is a central concept in MDP theory as it characterizes the value of the system's state with respect to future developments. We derive compact expressions for the generating functions for general families of value functions corresponding to often used cost structures defined in terms of waiting and sojourn times. Moreover, we consider systems with and without setup delays.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are used in numerous communication systems and application fields for cost reduction. While this trend is adopted in various home and business scenarios, most components for safety critical systems are proprietary or significantly modified. This also applies to networks using IP over Ethernet. Hardly any accepted methods to certify safety critical communication networks with such COTS components exist. This paper presents a Queueing Theory based heuristic to estimate end-to-end delay times for IP and Ethernet based communication systems with periodic traffic sources. Required input is information on the sources, network topology and routing. Traffic source models depending on few parameters, e.g. Interrupted-Poisson-Processes (IPPs), are used. Required network and source information can be obtained with reasonable effort in many domains, e.g. for maritime vessels. The feasibility of the methods introduced in this paper is therefore demonstrated for a ship network.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Middleboxes in private networks have been known to change packets in many ways, making it hard to design protocol extensions that work for the large majority of Internet users. Addressing the need to know what such middleboxes do, we introduce a tool called fling (``flexible ping''). fling can carry out (almost) any kind of protocol dialogue between a server and a client based on a simple specification in a json and a pcap file, and identify what middleboxes do to the packets of the dialogue. This fills a gap in the state of the art, where other tools that control both ends of a path are either limited in some form or have to be updated for every new test. We present results from small-scale tests that prove the flexibility of fling, which is a prerequisite for our next step: development of a large-scale measurement platform.
