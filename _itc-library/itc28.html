    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we present a model for evaluating bandwidth sharing
		policies, that can be applied to networks that handle both video streaming
		traffic, as well as other traffic. Video streaming is a demanding network
		application. In crowded networks, resources need to be properly divided in
		order not to diminish the streaming experience. However, in network
		deployments with a large number of users, the streaming performance cannot
		be obtained straightforwardly from a sharing policy. Therefore, we propose
		a Markov model that is compatible with Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
		(DASH), the major technology for video streaming over the Internet. If DASH
		is combined with in-network resource management, its performance can be
		significantly improved. Nevertheless, resource sharing policies need to be
		configured. This requires evaluating of many different configurations. Real
		deployments or network simulations demand many system resources and time.
		In contrast, our model can quickly evaluate many configurations, and for
		each configuration output the expected video bitrate and number of changes
		in video bitrate. These two parameters play an important role in the
		Quality of Experience of the viewer. In this paper, we demonstrate how our
		model can be used to analyze and optimize resource sharing policies. As
		such, our model is a useful tool for network administrators and allows them
		to better provision and configure their networks.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Given the inability of Highly-Distributed-Application-Developers to foresee
		the changes as well as the heterogeneity on the underlying infrastructure,
		it is considerable crucial the design and development of novel software
		paradigms that facilitate application developers to take advantage of the
		emerging programmability of the underlying infrastructure and therefore
		develop Reconfigurable-by-Design applications. In parallel, it is crucial
		to design solutions that are scalable, support high performance, are
		resilient-to-failure and take into account the conditions of their runtime
		environment. Towards this direction, the ARCADIA project aims to design and
		validate a Novel Reconfigurable-By-Design Highly Distributed Applications
		(HDAs) Development Paradigm over Programmable Infrastructure. The proposed
		framework relies on the development of an extensible Context Model which
		will be used by developers to produce annotated source-code and generate
		HDAs as service chains of application tiers and network functions
		containing meaningful semantics. A Smart Controller responsible for
		on-boarding the HDAs will undertake the tasks of translating annotations to
		optimal infrastructural configuration. Such a controller will enforce an
		optimal configuration to the registered programmable resources and will
		pro-actively adjust the configuration plan based on the Infrastructural
		State and the Application State to meet objectives and apply policies.
		Driving a HDA through its entire lifetime proves highly beneficial for all
		stakeholders since the synergy of the introduced applications
		reconfigurability and the underlying infrastructure's programmability
		facilitates the development of new fine-grained strategies able to fulfill
		new and complex requirements.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Reducing the CAPEX and OPEX is a major concern for Telecom Operators (TOs):
		to this extent, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has been considered a
		key aspect to virtualize network functions and push them to the NFV
		Infrastructure. Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) can be deployed as a set
		of components running on several cooperating Virtual Machines (VMs) inside
		modern data centers. As a consequence, it becomes crucial for network
		operators to minimize the power consumption of their NFV infrastructure, by
		using the minimum set of physical servers and networking equipment subject
		to the constraints that VNFs impose on the infrastructure in terms of
		compute, memory, disk and network resources requirements. In this work, we
		present a joint resources and flow routing assignment problem for VNFs
		placement, with the objective of minimizing both the power consumption of
		the servers and switches needed to deploy the overall virtualized
		infrastructure and routing graph. In contrast to many existing works
		assuming perfect knowledge on input parameters, such as traffic demands
		between the VNFs, which is difficult to predict, we propose a novel
		mathematical model based on the Robust Optimisation (RO) theory to deal
		with uncertainty on data. Our numerical evaluation applies focuses on a
		specific use-case, that is the deployment of a set of VNFs, typical of a
		virtualized Evolved Packet Core (vEPC), namely the core for next generation
		mobile networks. We demonstrate that with our model, a vEPC operator can
		trade-off between two important aspects: the power consumption minimization
		on one side, and the protection from severe deviations of the input
		parameters, such as traffic demands and compute resources needed by the
		individual VNFI components.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Most of the caching algorithms are oblivious to requests' timescale, but
		caching systems are capacity constrained and in practical cases the hit
		rate may be limited by the cache's impossibility to serve requests fast
		enough. In particular the hard-disk access time can be the key factor
		capping cache performances.
		In this paper, we present a new cache replacement policy that takes
		advantage
		of a hierarchical caching architecture, and in particular of access-time
		difference between memory and disk.
		Our policy is optimal when requests follow the independent reference
		model,
		and significantly reduces the hard-disk load, as shown also by our
		realistic,
		trace-driven evaluation.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The introduction of the two new paradigms Software Defined Networks (SDN)
		and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) in the Internet is
		revolutionizing its design and management, creating many new challenging
		problems regarding resource allocation and orchestration. Little attention
		has been paid up to now to the "intranode" resource allocation. In this
		context, this paper introduces an analytical model of an SDN/NFV node that
		implements NARR, a processor sharing strategy proposed by the same authors
		to reduce delays by assigning a larger processor slice to the flows that
		will leave the node through a less loaded output network interface card
		(NIC). Numerical results analytically demonstrates the gain achieved by
		applying NARR, and give important insights for future work.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Green data center is becoming more recognized as a likely key trend in the
		future of Information and Communications Technologies. It attracts growing
		interest among many scientists today due to many of its possessed benefits,
		such as increasing energy saving levels, cost reductions, as well as
		decreasing carbon emissions. In a data center, Server Virtualization and
		Live Migration technologies facilitate efficient load balancing and
		reduction in power consumption of servers. Although using these
		technologies has many benefits, they do not, however, take
		energy-efficiency of the network devices such as routers, switches into
		consideration. In this paper, we construct an energy-efficient data center
		by combining server consolidation and idle logic approach of the data
		center network.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Cloud services placement can be suboptimal in certain cases due to
		inefficient network design, which in turn impacts user Quality of
		Experience (QoE). Consequently, Application Service Providers (ASPs) need
		to manage cloud network infrastructures with efficient designs that fully
		satisfy Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of their data/video-intensive
		applications of users. To proactively avoid this problem, a straightforward
		solution used by ASPs is to have many replicas of their services by renting
		more resources from Infrastructure Providers (InPs) which can lead to an
		expensive service delivery proposition. In this paper, we present a novel
		possibilistic C-Means (PCM) approach to enhance user QoE in cloud service
		placement by clustering network infrastructure with awareness of user SLO
		satisfaction amidst network path constraints. Our evaluation results
		obtained using numerical simulations as well as in a real-world cloud
		testbed with actual users prove that our multi-constrained path aware PCM
		approach outperforms existing solutions. Specifically, we show how our
		proposed infrastructure clustering with the PCM approach allows ASPs to
		rent less resources from InPs that reduces user cost, while still
		delivering satisfactory user QoE.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Computer system and network performance can be significantly
		improved by caching frequently used information. When the cache size
		is limited, the cache replacement algorithm has an important impact
		on the effectiveness of caching. In this paper we introduce
		time-to-live (TTL) approximations to determine the cache hit
		probability of two classes of cache replacement algorithms: the
		recently introduced h-LRU and LRU(m). These approximations
		only require the requests to be generated according to a general
		Markovian arrival process (MAP). This includes phase-type renewal
		processes and the IRM model as special cases.
		
		We provide both numerical and theoretical support for the claim that
		the proposed TTL approximations are asymptotically exact. In
		particular, we show that the transient hit probability converges to
		the solution of a set of ODEs (under the IRM model), where the fixed
		point of the set of ODEs corresponds to the TTL approximation. We
		further show, by using synthetic and trace-based workloads, that
		h-LRU and LRU(m) perform alike, while the latter requires less work 
		when a hit/miss occurs. We also show that, as opposed to LRU, h-LRU 
		and LRU(m) are sensitive to the correlation between consecutive 
		inter-request times.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The network functions virtualization (NFV) paradigm provides advantages
		with respect to aspects like flexibility, costs, and scalability of
		networks. However, management and orchestration of the resulting networks
		also introduce new challenges. The placement of services and virtualized
		network functions (VNFs) is a multi-objective optimization task that
		confronts operators with a multitude of possible solutions that are
		incomparable among each other. The goal of this work is to investigate
		mechanisms that enable automated decision making between such multi
		dimensional solutions. To this end, we investigate techniques from the
		domain of multi attribute decision making that aggregate the performance of
		placements to a single numeric score. A comparison between resulting
		rankings of placements shows that many techniques produce similar results.
		Hence, placements that achieve good rankings according to many approaches
		might be viable candidates in the context of automated decision making.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we investigate the impact of random interactions 
		between agents in a social network on the diffusion of opinions 
		in the network.
		Opinion of each agent is assumed to be
		a binary variable taking values in the set 0, 1. 
		Each agent is assumed to be able to interact with any other agent
		in the network.
		This models scenarios where 
		every agent in the network has to choose from two available options
		and the size of the neighborhood of each agent is an increasing
		function of the total number agents in the network. 
		It is assumed that each agent updates its opinion at random instants upon
		interacting 
		with other randomly sampled agents.
		We consider two simple rules of interaction: (1) the voter rule
		in which the updating agent simply copies the opinion
		of another randomly sampled agent;
		(2) the majority rule, in which 
		the updating agent samples multiple agents
		and adopts the majority opinion among
		the sampled agents and the agent itself. 
		Under each rule, we consider
		two different scenarios which have note been
		considered in the literature thus far: (1) where the agents
		are `biased' towards one of the opinions,
		(2) where different agents have different degrees of stubbornness.
		We show that the presence of biased agents
		reduces the consensus time for the voter rule exponentially
		as compared to the case where the agents are unbiased.
		For the majority rule model with biased agents
		we show that the network reaches consensus on a particular opinion
		with high probability only when the initial fraction of agents
		having that opinion is above a certain threshold. 
		For the majority rule model with stubborn agents
		we observe metastability where the network
		switches back and forth between stable states spending long 
		intervals in each state.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> On video streaming platforms, users expect a high QoE. In contrast, service
		and content providers aim at high User Engagement, most notably because
		their revenue is usually dependent on it. In order to satisfy users, it is
		critical to know how QoE is related to the User Engagement. However, no
		model for this relation exists yet. Current approaches to managing QoE are
		usually based on traffic analysis. However, in the future Internet this
		will become more difficult since the encryption of Internet traffic
		progresses.
		
		In this paper, we present an approach to bringing QoE and User Engagement
		together with video streaming as the use case. We do this by fitting
		existing measurement data of User Engagement to obtain a model.
		Furthermore, we extend the existing queuing model for QoE and investigate
		the correlation between QoE and User Engagement in a simulation. Hereby, we
		model different scenarios where we quantify network bandwidth and video
		requirements.
		
		Our results show that there is a strong correlation between QoE and User
		Engagement. Additionally, we observe that simple buffer policies that do
		not rely on buffer information can still perform well. These revelations
		open the way for new approaches to QoE Management in the future Internet.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Packet processing (e.g. routing, switching, firewall functionality) with
		commodity hardware is a cost-efficient and flexible alternative to
		specialized networking hardware. On commodity hardware the CPU typically
		becomes the bottleneck in packet processing. However, in well-known QoS
		mechanisms (e.g. DiffServ, IntServ), the outgoing link is assumed to be the
		bottleneck. This limitation is unfavorable, in particular for
		latency-sensitive applications (e.g. VoIP, video conferencing, online
		gaming). Thus, we propose and implement a QoS concept for a Linux software
		router to prioritize latency-sensitive traffic at the incoming network
		interface. Our testbed measurements show that our prototype implementation
		improves the packet processing w.r.t the latency of latency-sensitive
		traffic even under high traffic loads.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Internet has witnessed the proliferation of applications and services
		that rely on HTTP as application protocol. Users play games, read emails,
		watch videos, chat and access web pages using their PC, which in turn
		downloads tens or hundreds of URLs to fetch all objects that are needed to
		display the requested content. As a results, billions of URLs are observed
		in the network.
		When monitoring the traffic, thus, it is becoming more and more important
		to have methodologies that allow one to dig into this data, and extract
		useful information. In this paper, we present CLUE, Clustering for URL
		Exploration, a methodology that leverage clustering algorithms, i.e.,
		classic unsupervised approaches developed in the data mining field, to
		extract knowledge from passive observation of URLs carried by the network.
		This is a challenging problem, given the unstructured format of URLs,
		which, being strings, call for specialized approaches. Inspired by
		text-mining algorithms, we face this problem by introducing a concept of
		URL-distance, and using it to extract URL clusters using the classic DBSCAN
		algorithm.
		Experiments on actual datasets show encouraging results: well-separated and
		consistent clusters emerge and allow us to identify, e.g., malicious
		traffic, file hosting services, and third- party tracking services. In a
		nutshell, our clustering algorithm offers the means to get insights on the
		data carried by the network, with possible applications in the security, or
		privacy protection fields.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Caching and multipath forwarding are essential ingredients of the
		Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architecture resulting from ubiquitous
		content storage and content-based node-by-node forwarding nature of ICN,
		much is yet to see how they jointly act towards improving user's quality of
		experience. To this end, we formulate in this paper a unified problem of
		caching and multipath forwarding as a network optimization problem to
		maximize user satisfaction which is expressed by their utility function.
		The formulation allows us to see caching and multipath forwarding in ICN
		from a congestion control perspective and to reinforce the advantage of a
		class of congestion-aware caching where in-network caches are used to
		absorb network congestion and to enhance user's satisfaction. In that
		context, multipath forwarding plays the role of directing content delivery
		to less congested paths where network capacity is abundant or where
		requested content has been stored by in-network caches. We evaluate such a
		congestion control-based, coupled caching and multipath forwarding approach
		in simulations. The result confirms the advantage of our approach compared
		with existing ones.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The impact of waiting times in interactive and web-based services on the
		Quality of Experience (QoE) has attracted high interest. Most studies aim
		at understanding the QoE impact of waiting times in specific laboratories
		or in the user's domestic environment. Enterprise and working environments
		have been largely ignored. This mostly stems from two factors: i) the high
		complexity of enterprise systems hindering the exact monitoring of relevant
		application response times on user granularity and ii) disturbances of the
		day-to-day business by user studies resulting in less productive
		employees.
		This paper approaches these challenges by combining non-intrusive
		application monitoring of response times and subjective user ratings on the
		perceived application performance. The correlation between objective
		measurements and subjective ratings is evaluated using different machine
		learning approaches. The results imply a high correlation for specific
		users, but do not allow to deviate a generic model.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> As the amount of mobile devices populating the Internet keeps growing at
		tremendous pace, context-aware services have gained a lot of traction
		thanks to the wide set of potential use cases they can be applied to.
		Environmental sensing applications, emergency services and location-aware
		messaging are just a few examples of applications that are expected to
		increase in popularity in the next few years.
		
		The MobilityFirst future Internet architecture, a clean-slate Internet
		architecture design, provides the necessary abstractions for creating and
		managing context-aware services. Starting from these abstractions we design
		a context services framework, which is based on a set of three fundamental
		mechanisms: an easy way to specify context based on human understandable
		techniques, i.e. use of names; an architecture supported management
		mechanism that allows both to conveniently deploy the service and
		efficiently provide management capabilities; and a native delivery system
		that reduces the tax on the network components and on the overhead cost of
		deploying such applications. 
		
		In this paper, we present an emergency alert system for vehicles assisting
		first responders that exploits users location awareness to support quick
		and reliable alert messages for interested vehicles. By deploying a demo of
		the system on a nationwide testbed, we aim to provide better understanding
		of the dynamics involved in our designed framework.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Network virtualization is one classical use-case for Software Defined
		Networks (SDN). By programmatically instantiating virtual networks, traffic
		from one or more devices can be separated or connectivity can be
		established as needed. S-BYOD, which is presented in this demonstration,
		applies the SDN concept to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios and
		offers personalized virtual networks that are set up and extended on
		demand. This is done once the user authenticates, activates access to
		additional applications, or as soon as applications scale out and involve
		more servers. The described proof-of-concept implementation explores, to
		what degree an agent-less BYOD solution, based only on SDN, can lower the
		attack surface by explicit user opt-ins for particular services. Further,
		an assessment of the number of required rules within the flow tables of
		switches completes this work.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Distributed aggregation algorithms have traditionally been applied to
		environments with no or rather low rates of node churn.
		The proliferation of mobile devices in recent years introduces high
		mobility and node churn to these environments, thus imposing a new
		dimension on the problem of distributed aggregation in terms of scalability
		and convergence speed.
		To address this, we present DiVote, a distributed voting protocol for
		mobile device-to-device communication. We investigate a particular use
		case, in which pedestrians equipped with mobile phones roam around in an
		urban area and participate in a distributed yes/no poll, which has both
		spatial and temporal relevance to the community. Each node casts a vote and
		collects votes from other participants in the system whenever in
		communication range; votes are immediately integrated into a local
		estimate. The objective of DiVote is to produce a precise mapping of the
		local estimate to the anticipated global voting result while preserving
		node privacy. Since mobile devices may have limited resources allocated for
		mobile sensing activities, DiVote utilizes D-GAP compression. We evaluate
		the proposed protocol via extensive trace-driven simulations of realistic
		pedestrian behavior, and demonstrate that it scales well with the number of
		nodes in the system. Furthermore, in densely populated areas the local
		estimate of participants does not deviate by more than 2.5 % from the
		global result. Finally, in certain scenarios the achievable compression
		rate of DiVote is at least 19 % for realistic vote distributions.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigated challenges in network disaster management
		against tsunamis. A tsunami is a natural disaster of
		which the arrival time and devastating effect can be predicted.
		Based on this prediction, network operators can carry out
		different disaster management actions to avoid or reduce the
		damaging effect of tsunami on the network. We developed
		and evaluated heuristic algorithms to efficiently migrate service
		(virtual) networks away from a disaster affected area to minimize
		traffic loss when a tsunami arrives. The problem was first
		formulated as an integer linear programming problem, which
		can be solved using optimization solvers for small/medium-sized
		networks. For large networks, our heuristic algorithms ensure
		a good solution within a reasonable time. Extensive simulations
		were carried out to evaluate the performance of our proposed
		algorithms. On the basis of the tsunami predicted information
		and network status, network operators can select a suitable
		algorithm for their disaster management action.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The growing popularity of mobile multimedia content and the increase of
		wireless access bitrates are straining backhaul capacity in mobile
		networks. A cost-effective solution to reduce the strain, enabled by
		emerging all-IP 4G and 5G mobile backhaul architectures, could be
		in-network caching of popular content during times of peak demand. In this
		paper we formulate the problem of content caching in a mobile backhaul as a
		binary integer programming problem, and we propose a 2-approximation
		algorithm for the problem. The 2-approximation requires full information
		about the network topology and the link costs, as well as about the content
		demands at the different caches, we thus propose two distributed algorithms
		that are based on local information on the content demands. We show that
		the distributed algorithms terminate in a finite number of steps, and we
		provide analytical results on their approximation ratios. We use
		simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms in terms of the achieved
		approximation ratio and computational complexity on realistic mobile
		backhaul topologies.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In-network caching is an appealing solution to cope with the increasing
		bandwidth demand of video, audio and data transfer over the Internet.
		Nonetheless, an increasing share of content delivery services adopt
		encryption through HTTPS, which is not compatible with traditional
		ISP-managed approaches like transparent and proxy caching. This raises the
		need for solutions involving both Internet Service Providers (ISP) and
		Content Providers (CP): by design, the solution should preserve
		business-critical CP information (e.g., content popularity, user
		preferences) on the one hand, while allowing for a deeper integration of
		caches in the ISP architecture (e.g., in 5G femto-cells) on the other hand.
		
		In this paper we address this issue by considering a content-oblivious
		ISP-operated cache. The ISP allocates the cache storage to various content
		providers so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache:
		the main novelty lies in the fact that, to protect business-critical
		information, ISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of the
		individual CPs. We propose a cache allocation algorithm based on a
		perturbed stochastic subgradient method, and prove that the algorithm
		converges to the allocation that maximizes the overall cache hit rate. We
		use extensive simulations to validate the algorithm and to assess its
		convergence rate under stationary and non-stationary content popularities.
		Our results (i) testify the feasibility of content-oblivious caches and
		(ii) show that the proposed algorithm can achieve within 15% from the
		global optimum in our evaluation.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging approach that has
		received attention from both academia and industry as a way to improve
		flexibility, efficiency, and manageability of networks. 
		NFV enables new ways to operate networks and to provide composite network
		services, opening the path toward new business models. 
		As in cloud computing with the Infrastructure as a Service model, clients
		will be offered the capability to provision and instantiate Virtual Network
		Functions (VNF) on the NFV infrastructure of the network operators. 
		
		In this paper, we consider the case where leftover VNF capacities are
		offered for bid. This approach is particularly interesting for clients to
		punctually provision resources to absorb peak or unpredictable demands and
		for operators to increase their revenues.
		We propose a game theoretic approach and make use of Multi-Unit
		Combinatorial Auctions to select the winning clients and the price they
		pay.
		Such a formulation allows clients to express their VNF requests according
		to their specific objectives. 
		We solve this problem with a greedy heuristic and prove that this
		approximation of economic efficiency is the closest attainable in
		polynomial time and provides a payment system that motivates bidders to
		submit their true valuations. 
		Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic achieves a market
		valuation close to the optimal (less than 10 % deviation) and guarantees
		that an important part of this valuation is paid as revenue to the
		operator.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In the current Internet video streaming is dominating fixed and mobile
		consumer traffic. However, wireless and mobile networks may lack bandwidth
		or suffer from severe bandwidth fluctuations. The question arises: What is
		the impact of bandwidth fluctuations on the Quality of Service (QoS) and
		the user perceived quality? The key contribution of this paper is the
		analysis of QoS in terms of application-level parameters (stalling duration
		and frequency) for reliable video-on-demand streaming. The QoS is mapped to
		Quality of Experience (QoE) based on an existing QoS-QoE model for HTTP
		streaming. Different network conditions, in particular average and
		variances of network bandwidths, and video bit rates are taken into account
		in the analysis. We approach this problem by modeling the video player as a
		queueing system and evaluate the transient phase of the non-stationary
		system by means of discrete-event simulations. The results of our study
		show that the characteristics of the network have a high impact on the QoS
		and a surprisingly low impact on the QoE under certain conditions.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Assessing the impact of network delay on gaming quality has been subject to
		many studies involving different genres ranging from fast-paced
		first-person shooters to strategy games. This paper assesses the impact of
		network latency on the Quality of Experience (QoE) of casual gamers with
		Minecraft. It is based on a user study involving 12 casual gamers with no
		prior Minecraft experience. The QoE is assessed using the Game Experience
		Questionnaire (GEQ) and dedicated questions for the overall perceived
		quality and experienced interruptions. The main finding is that casual
		Minecraft players are rather insensitive to network delay of up to 1 sec.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Collecting information from web clients without explicit input from users
		is important in a variety of contexts including content customization,
		experience personalization, accounting and online advertising. A standard
		approach for gathering web client telemetry is through deployment of
		Javascript instrumentation that is placed either directly on web pages or
		through third-party "tags" that are referenced in web pages. In this
		paper we present a design study of web client measurement methods. The
		objective of our work is to enhance understanding of best practices in web
		client measurement toward the goal of developing future tags that are
		reliable, robust and efficient. We begin by conducting a detailed
		examination of Javascript instrumentation collected from five well known
		third party services. Our analysis shows that these code-bases have diverse
		capabilities and return a broad range of client characteristics. Next, we
		describe a web client measurement framework and an implementation that we
		call IntegraTag, which enables us to examine details of performance,
		accuracy and reliability through live deployments. We use IntegraTag to
		conduct case studies of tag behavior on a single website which resulted in
		over 500K page-loads, and on a publisher network which resulted in over
		150M page-loads. We report on the wide range of client characteristics
		returned by IntegraTag, as well as it's performance and robustness.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we address the joint problem of user association and
		resource allocation in wireless heterogeneous networks. Therefore, we
		formulate an optimization approach considering two objectives, namely,
		maximizing the number of served User Equipments (UEs) and maximizing the
		sum of the UE utilities. Precisely, the aim is to associate UEs with the
		optimal Radio Access Technology (RAT) and to allocate to these UEs the
		optimal Resource Units (RUs) based on their requested services and
		contracts. Our problem is challenging because it is mixed integer
		non-linear optimization. To tackle this difficulty, we provide a Mixed
		Integer Linear Programming (MILP) re-formulation of the problem that makes
		it computationally tractable. Various preferences for user association and
		resource allocation are conducted by tuning: on the one hand, the weights
		associated with different services and contracts; on the other hand, the
		weights associated with the considered two objectives. The optimal solution
		of the MILP problem is computed for a realistic network scenario and
		compared with legacy solution. Extensive simulation results show that the
		proposed optimization approach improves the overall network performance
		while considering the UE requested service and contract: it outperforms
		legacy solutions in terms of user satisfaction. Moreover, it provides an
		efficient distribution of UEs on the different RATs.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) have been regarded as a promising
		architecture for energy-efficient fifth generation systems. In this paper,
		a new joint remote radio head (RRH) activation, user-RRH pairing and
		resource allocation strategy is proposed for heterogeneous C-RANs
		(H-CRANs). We first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the
		energy efficiency of H-CRANs. Then, a low-complexity suboptimal solution is
		developed. Our proposed mechanism consists of three key procedures: 1) RRH
		activation is performed based on greedy RRH selection; 2) user-RRH pairing
		is performed based on the channel quality; 3) the resource allocation
		problem is solved by dual decomposition. Simulation results show that the
		proposed strategy can improve energy efficiency significantly.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper we describe LiveTalk, a framework for Collaborative
		Browser-based Replicated-Computation applications. LiveTalk permits
		multiple users separated across the wide area to interact with separate
		copies of a single application, sharing a single virtual workspace, using
		very little network bandwidth. LiveTalk features an integrated
		browser-based programming environment with native graphics and live
		evaluation, an integrated, pluggable web server, and a simple messaging
		service that serves to coordinate activity on shared application sessions,
		and provides for multiple mutually-isolated sessions. The first use case
		for LiveTalk is collaborative big-data visualizations running on
		thin-client devices such as cellular phones, tablets, and netbooks. These
		applications form part of a new class of application where the distributed
		cloud is leveraged to provide low latency, high-bandwidth access to
		geographically disparate users while maintaining the feel of immediacy
		associated with local computation. The primary motivation of this work is
		to permit low latency collaborative applications to be built quickly and
		easily, while requiring no setup for use by the end-user.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We consider single- and multi-server systems, where jobs have a maximum
		waiting time (deadline) defined, e.g., by a service level agreement. A
		fixed cost is a cost associated with deadline violations and the task is to
		minimize the long-run cumulative costs. Job sizes (service durations) are
		observed upon arrival, and current queue backlogs are known. For a single
		FCFS server, the optimization task is to find the optimal admission policy
		that may reject a job upon arrival if admitting it would cause in future
		one or more deadlines to be violated (in expectation). For parallel FCFS
		servers, the policy must (i) either accept or reject a job upon arrival,
		and if accepted, (ii) assign it to one of the servers. We derive efficient
		deadline-aware policies in the MDP framework. For a single server, we
		obtain the optimal admission policy. For dispatching to parallel servers,
		we develop efficient heuristic admission and dispatching policies, whose
		performances are evaluated by means of numerical examples. Additionally, we
		give some exact closed-form results for heavy-traffic limits.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We design and build a system we call mobiLivUp, that utilizes nearby
		smartphones to improve live wide-area video upstreaming. In mobiLivUp, to
		distribute the video to nearby devices, the video streaming device creates
		a small wireless network using Wi-Fi Direct. Other devices then connect to
		this network. Parts of the video stream are sent to these connected
		devices, which then upload their parts to a location in the wide-area
		network using their cellular connections. We develop algorithms and methods
		to effectively distribute video data to nearby nodes and for incentivizing
		cooperation from these nodes. We test our system through trace-driven
		simulation and implementation in various settings. Our experiments show
		that, in general, mobiLivUp increases the aggregate video throughput,

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Large scale deployments of general cache networks, such as Content Delivery
		Networks or Information Centric Networking architectures, arise new
		challenges regarding their performance evaluation for network planning. On
		the one hand, analytical models can hardly represent all the detailed
		interaction of complex replacement, replication, and routing policies on
		arbitrary topologies. On the other hand, the sheer size of network and
		content catalogs makes event-driven simulation techniques inherently
		non-scalable. We propose a new technique for the performance evaluation of
		large scale caching systems that intelligently integrates elements of
		stochastic analysis within a MonteCarlo simulative approach, that we
		colloquially refer to as ModelGraft. Our approach (i) leverages the
		intuition that complex scenarios can be mapped to a simpler equivalent
		scenario that builds upon Time-To-Live (TTL) caches; it (ii) significantly
		downscales the scenario to lower computation and memory complexity, while,
		at the same time, preserving its properties to limit accuracy loss;
		finally, it (iii) is simple to use and robust, as it autonomously converges
		to a consistent state through a feedback-loop control system, regardless of
		the initial state. Performance evaluation shows that, with respect to
		classic event-driven simulation, ModelGraft gains over two orders of
		magnitude in both CPU time and memory complexity, while limiting accuracy
		loss below 2%. In addition, we show that ModelGraft extends performance
		evaluation well beyond the boundaries of classic approaches, by enabling
		study of Internet scale scenarios with content catalogs comprising hundreds
		of billions objects.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> User satisfaction is becoming a key factor to secure the success of any
		online service. Quality of Experience is a subjective measure of the
		service quality as perceived by the user. QoE has been introduced to bridge
		the gap between the purely technical characteristics of QoS and user
		satisfaction. Recent research on QoE has shown that QoE is highly personal
		and influenced by multiple interrelated factors including the user
		expectations, her cultural background and preferences.
		However, most existing QoE management solutions overlook the personal
		aspect of QoE and ignore inter-user differences despite the promise of
		adopting a user-centric approach. In this paper, we propose multi-agent
		technology as means to achieve personalized QoE-management. In particular,
		we propose a multi-agent architecture called EMan where each end-user is
		embodied by an autonomous agent that represents her personal preferences
		and expectations and seeks to maximize her QoE. To evaluate our approach,
		we use Repast, a multi-agent simulation platform. The preliminary results
		show that the personalized multi-agent model offers a better subjective QoE
		to users than centralized models that ignore inter-user differences.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The sharing of computing and networking resources in the cloud is
		challenged by several obstacles, such as providing bandwidth guarantees for
		a predictable performance of the hosted applications, as well as
		maintaining their availability upon any failure. Therefore, the wide scale
		adoption of this emerging computing paradigm is highly dependent on
		overcoming these challenges. In fact, the lack of bandwidth guarantees
		extends the completion time for jobs, thus increasing cloud clients
		expenses, who pay based on their use. In addition, outages in cloud data
		centers may result in severe revenue losses for both cloud operators and
		their clients alike. 
		
		Now, to mitigate these challenges, cloud operators should be empowered with
		a strategic protection plan able to guarantee resilient and predictable
		performance for applications. Such a plan consists of provisioning
		additional backup resources (e.g. virtual machines, bandwidth) while
		ensuring efficient network bandwidth utilization. In this work, we exploit
		several bandwidth sharing opportunities in multi-tenant cloud networks
		while offering resilient and bandwidth guaranteed services. In contrast to
		previous works which target cloud clients satisfaction, we focus on
		optimizing network bandwidth utilization in order to increase the cloud
		operators' revenues while maintaining such bandwidth allocation transparent
		to the clients. Through several motivational examples, we highlight the
		sharing opportunities and show that they are able to increase cloud
		operators revenue while providing up to 50% of bandwidth gain in the
		network.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) linear channel coding can greatly increase
		wireless system capacity when Stations (STAs) have fewer antennas than the
		Access Point (AP), but it comes at the cost of significant Channel State
		Information (CSI) estimation overhead. Previous work has suggested that
		802.11af MU-MIMO systems might benefit from long channel coherence time,
		extending the useful duration of CSI. In this paper, we propose and analyze
		an opportunistic channel sounding policy that avoids sounding overhead in
		wireless channels by gathering implicit CSI opportunistically. This policy
		not only avoids CSI overhead, but also has the potential to enable
		efficient interoperability of multi-user APs with legacy single-stream
		STAs. To investigate the performance of this new policy, we implement a new
		mobile channel sounding framework on a custom 802.11af Software-Defined
		Radio (SDR) system designed for UHF-band experimentation and evaluate
		channel sounding performance in indoor and outdoor environments under
		various mobility modes. Additional protocol analysis shows that in UHF
		channels with sufficient channel coherence time, an opportunistic channel
		sounding policy offers significant protocol optimization while improving
		the scalability of next-generation MU-MIMO systems.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Exponential traffic growth due to the increasing popularity of Over-The-Top
		Video services has put service providers under much pressure. By promoting
		in-network caching, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a promising
		paradigm to answer current challenges in the service provider's domain.
		This paper reports on a cache placement strategy for service providers to
		delay the onset of congestion (time-to-exhaustion) to the extent possible
		in order to optimize their capital expenditure for their limited capacity
		planning budget. We show that even a limited deployment of ICN provides a
		substantial increase in the time-to-exhaustion of the network and a

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In the recent years, the bufferbloat phenomenon was observed which is
		mainly due to oversized unmanaged buffers in the Internet. This triggered a
		new discussion of active queue management (AQM) algorithms in the IETF.
		"Controlled Delay" (CoDel) and "Proportional Integral controller
		Enhanced" (PIE) are considered as an alternative to "Random Early
		Detection" (RED). Their intention is both to take advantage of large
		buffers for occasional bursts and to limit queueing delays most of the
		time. Moreover, they are able to cope with varying bandwidth. In this
		paper, we study the performance of CoDel, PIE, and CoDel-ACT, which is an
		effective modification of CoDel that leads to better performance than CoDel
		in our studies. We experiment with saturated TCP sources and a
		fixed-bandwidth bottleneck link and focus on the delay-limiting phase of
		the algorithms. We investigate the impact of configuration parameters and
		traffic load on link utilization and queueing delay. We study the timely
		evolution of queuing delays and drop patterns, and point out significant
		differences among the algorithms. In particular, we show that CoDel's drop
		behavior changes over time and may lead to underutilization.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The topic of Internet content caching regained relevance over the last
		years due to extending data center infrastructures in CDNs, clouds and ISP
		networks to meet capacity and delay demands of multimedia services. In this
		study, we evaluate the performance of web caching strategies in terms of
		the achievable hit rate for realistic scenarios of large user populations.
		We focus on a class of score gated least recently used (SG-LRU) strategies
		which combine the simple update effort of the usual LRU policy with the
		flexibility to keep most important content in the cache according to a
		predefined score function. Caching efficiency is evaluated via simulations
		assuming Zipf request pattern, which has been confirmed manifold on popular
		web platforms for video streaming and other types of content. For the
		standard independent request model (IRM), we analyze the possible hit rate
		gain of other web caching strategies over pure LRU within the complete
		relevant range of three basic system parameters. The results confirm that
		absolute hit rate gains of 10%-20% over LRU being observed in some case
		studies for alternative caching strategies are not optimistic but a
		realistic estimation in general. Finally, we compare IRM evaluations with
		results for varying request pattern over time based on Wikipedia
		statistics, which recently have been made available for daily top-1000 page
		requests. Simulations are extended to show the impact of varying object

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The softwarization of networks promises cost savings and better scalability
		of network functions by moving functionality from specialized devices into
		commercial-off-the-shelf hardware. Generalized computing hardware offers
		many degrees for adjustment and tuning, which can affect performance and
		resource utilization. One of these adjustments are the interrupt mitigation
		techniques implemented by modern network interface cards and operating
		systems. By this, an administrator can optimize either lower latencies or
		lower CPU overhead for processing of network traffic. In this work, an
		analytical model allowing the computation of relevant performance metrics
		like the packet processing time and the packet loss for generic virtualized
		network functions running on commodity hardware is introduced. The
		applicability of the model is shown by comparing its outcome with
		measurements conducted in a local testbed. Based on this model, impact
		factors like the average packet interarrival time, the interarrival time

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> The development of mobile virtual network operators, where multiple
		wireless technologies (e.g. 3G and 4G) or operators with non-overlapping
		bandwidths are pooled and shared is expected to provide enhanced service
		with broader coverage, without incurring additional infrastructure cost.
		However, their emergence poses an unsolved question on how to harness such
		a technology and bandwidth diversity. This paper addresses one of the
		simplest questions in this class, namely, the issue of associating each
		mobile to one of those bandwidths. Intriguingly, this association issue is
		intrinsically distinct from those in traditional networks. We first propose
		a generic stochastic geometry model lending itself to analyzing a wide
		class of association policies exploiting various information on the network
		topology, e.g. received pilot powers and fading values. This model firstly
		paves the way for tailoring and designing an optimal association scheme to
		maximize any performance metric of interest (such as the probability of
		coverage) subject to the information known about the network. In this class
		of optimal association, we prove a result that the performance improves as
		the information known about the network increases. Secondly, this model is
		used to quantify the performance of any arbitrary association policy and
		not just the optimal association policy. We propose a simple policy called
		the Max-Ratio which is not-parametric, i.e. it dispenses with the
		statistical knowledge of base station deployments commonly used in
		stochastic geometry models. We also prove that this simple policy is
		optimal in a certain limiting regime of the wireless environment. Our
		analytical results are combined with simulations to compare these policies

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> PlanetIgnite is a general-purpose, Infrastructure-as-a-Service,
		self-assembling, lightweight edge cloud on virtualized infrastructure with
		support for single-pane-of-glass distributed application configuration and
		deployment. This is an entirely new concept. PlanetLab, GENI, and SAVI are
		general-purpose IaaS edge clouds, but require top-down installation and
		dedicated hardware resources at each site and do not offer
		single-pane-of-glass application deployment. Seattle is a lightweight
		self-assembling edge cloud that offers single-pane-of-class configuration
		and control, but developers are restricted to using a subset of Python.
		PlanetIgnite is a Containers-as-a-Service Edge Cloud which offers Docker
		Containers as a Service to each PlanetIgnite user. A PlanetIgnite node is
		an off-the-shelf Ubuntu 14.04 Virtual machine with Docker installed,
		meaning it can be installed on any edge node where a VM with a routable v4
		address is available. Adding a PlanetIgnite node to the infrastructure is
		simple: a site wishing to host a PlanetIgnite node simply downloads the
		image; on boot, the new PlanetIgnite node registers with the PlanetIgnite
		portal, which runs a series of acceptance tests. Once complete, the image
		is registered and the node is added to the set of PlanetIgnite sites.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Software-defined networks (SDNs) come with great promises regarding
		flexible operation of networks. A key component within SDN-switches is the
		flow table which holds the rules that determine how data streams are
		handled. The flow table, however, is a scarce resource with a rather
		limited rule capacity. To soften this well-known hassle, PBCE (Port Based
		Capacity Extension) provides the possibility to delegate flows to a
		so-called extension switch (e.g., neighboring switch) in order to utilize
		flow table resources of this switch. Delegation is performed without
		breaking control plane transparency, i.e., without interfering with
		established SDN applications. To do so, PBCE uses flow rule aggregation
		based on ingress ports and a small set of predefined rules at the initial
		switch that are needed to redirect incoming flows to a dynamically chosen
		output port. In this paper, we present the PBCE delegation architecture for
		OpenFlow-based SDNs along with a basic mechanism for flow table capacity
		outsourcing. A prototypical implementation and first promising performance
		results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Within this paper, we
		focus on flow table scalability, the concept of PBCEs can, however, be
		applied to other delegation scenarios.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In Software Defined Networking (SDN), a central controller can achieve
		fine-grained control over individual flows by installing appropriate
		forwarding rules in switches and routers. This allows the network to
		realize a wide variety of functionalities and objectives. But at the same
		time, these flexibility and versatility come at the expense of (1) a huge
		burden on the limited Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) space, and
		(2) limited scalability due to the large number of forwarding rules that
		are required in the network. To address these limitations, we present
		Sector, a switch memory-aware routing scheme that reduces the number of
		entries in the switches, and at the same time guarantees the load balancing
		on link resources utilization. We consider both the static and dynamic
		versions and propose solution algorithms. Experiments show our algorithms
		can reduce the TCAM space usage and network control traffic by 20% to 80%
		on different network topologies.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Modern service providers use virtualization for a feasible scalability of
		their applications.
		Their approaches mainly exploit virtual machines to stem the quality of
		service requirements, especially redundancy, reliability and security. 
		Accordingly, provided services are hosted in data centers, which are able
		to fulfill the needs. 
		The standards of entry burden small enterprises to establish their own
		distributed service delivery cloud. 
		Hence, we already developed an energy-efficient solution, called Hypriot
		Cluster Lab (HCL).
		It adapts Docker technologies in a way that it runs on ARM powered single
		board computers.
		Forthwith, we demonstrate how it works with redundancy and replication
		betwixt several hosts on different locations via wide area networks.
		Accordingly, we use a mesh network based on virtual private LANs to
		communicate encrypted over the Internet between the distributed hosts.
		In our demonstration we present a fault tolerant, reliable and secure
		extension to interconnect several independent host with HCL to achieve the
		QoS-requirements.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a framework for building software-defined radios that
		are able to self-optimize their parameters using evolutionary algorithms.
		The framework has been implemented using the DEAP library for Python, which
		is based on the Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The paper discusses the overall
		system architecture and presents a system prototype that has been employed
		to optimize radio transmission parameters in an unknown radio environment
		in order to maximize the achievable throughput. Although GAs have been used
		before for optimizing the radio parameters of Software Defined Radios
		(SDRs), they have been limited to the number of parameters given as an
		input to the GA. The proposed algorithm is much more generic and
		comprehensive to utilize the advantages of genetic algorithms, by providing
		the flexibility to include any of the parameters of the configuration of
		the SDR, which needs to be optimized through the GA. Moreover, the entire
		project is based on open-source solutions. The current prototype targets
		Iris-based SDRs. However, as the entire software employs standard
		components for interfacing the SDR, it can easily be ported to GNU Radio or
		other SDR frameworks. We will also present preliminary results that have
		been obtained through over-the-air experiments in which we optimized
		different power parameters, modulation, coding schemes, etc., in an unknown
		radio environment.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Promising perspectives of a hypothetical `Tactile Internet', or `Internet
		at the speed of light', whereby network latencies become imperceptible to

		Internet latencies. In this paper we revisit the queueing analysis of the
		versatile Markov Fluid traffic model, which was mainly investigated in the
		1980-90s, yet
		with questionable accuracy. We derive upper bounds on the tail distribution
		of the queue size, which improve state-of-the-art results by an exponential
		factor O(κ^n), where 0<κ<1 and n is the number of
		multiplexed sources; additionally, we provide the first lower bounds. The
		underlying results are quite general in that they can be easily adapted to
		derive the delay distribution for SP, FIFO, and EDF scheduling. Our overall
		results rely on a powerful martingale methodology which was recently shown

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In the past decade it has been found that many Internet operators offer
		worse service to selected user traffic by applying various differentiation
		techniques. If from a legal point of view many countries have discussed and
		approved laws in favour of Internet neutrality, confirmation with measuring
		tools for even an experienced user remains hard in practice. In this paper
		we extend and complete our tool ChkDiff, previously presented for the
		upstream case, by checking for shaping also on the user's downstream
		traffic. After attempting to localize shapers at the access ISP on upstream
		traffic, we replay downstream traffic from a measurement server and analyze
		per-flow one-way delays and losses, while taking into account the
		possibility of multiple paths between the two endpoints. As opposed to
		other proposals in the literature, our methodology does not depend on any
		specific Internet application a user might want to test and it is robust to
		evolving differentiation techniques at the IP layer. We provide here a
		detailed description of the downstream tool and a validation in the wild
		for wired, wireless and 3G connections.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Multimedia services, such as HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) and audio
		conferencing, hold a dominant share in Internet traffic and are critical to
		end-user quality of experience (QoE). Since a distributed,
		application-level adaptation to the available network resources may not
		result in an optimal and fair QoE among heterogeneous clients, there is the
		need for a coordinated application-network interaction (App-Net), which
		includes exchange of monitoring and control information between the
		involved entities. Numerous App-Net approaches have been proposed, but
		typically for very specific use cases. A systematic comparison of such
		solutions, which would identify their pros and cons, as well as potential
		application scenarios, is missing. Our paper addresses this gap by
		providing an overview of QoE-centric App-Net mechanisms and deducing an
		abstract interaction model. In order to evaluate a trade-off between QoE
		gains and the messaging overhead, we use the latter model to compare two
		App-Net mechanisms for HAS against a baseline HAS implementation.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Different network applications have different service preferences regarding
		packet delay and buffering. Delay management requires scheduling support at
		routers, which traditionally also requires some form of traffic
		specification and admission control. In contrast, this paper studies the
		problem of guaranteeing queueing delay bounds for multiple service classes
		without traffic contracts and without affecting the throughput rate for
		each class. A solution to this problem is given by decoupling throughput
		and delay management via traffic-driven implicit buffer management. Using
		this concept, the Delay Segment FIFO (DSF) packet scheduler guarantees
		differentiated delay targets in the presence of unregulated throughput
		rates. This decoupling represents a modular approach and DSF embodies a
		small and self-contained feature set. Furthermore, DSF's service model
		satisfies even a strict interpretation of network neutrality, while
		effectively guaranteeing delay targets for multiple service classes. DSF's
		design and service characteristics are analyzed mathematically and
		validated through simulations.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we look at YouTube's algorithm for the adaptation of the
		video resolution, and analyze how much more mileage can be gotten out of
		it. In previous work, we analyzed the efficiency of YouTube's adaptation
		strategy by using isotonic regression that has the disadvantage of not
		eliminate stalling events. As a next step, we apply use an optimization
		problem to provide the optimal result in any given scenario while avoiding
		stalling events. This paper provides an outlook on the potential that is
		left for improving YouTube's adaptation mechanism that is essential to
		managing the QoE in video streaming.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers a holistic view of the network
		through a centralized control plane. Consequently, routing decisions can be
		made based on global knowledge about the network topology as well as its
		current state. As long living flows are suitable candidates for rerouting,
		their detection is crucial for efficient flow based traffic management.
		This work proposes the ZOOM algorithm for elephant detection in SDN
		networks. To this end, ZOOM follows a very lightweight approach that only
		uses packet counters implemented by OpenFlow switches and thus does not
		require any additional hardware. By exploiting this feature of OpenFlow
		switches, ZOOM allows lightweight and cost-effective elephant detection.</div>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> LISP is a standardized overlay protocol implementing the locator/identifier
		split for the Internet. Multiple extensions exist, e.g., for NAT traversal,
		traffic engineering, etc. Existing LISP implementations are mostly
		platform-specific, hard to extend or they are closed source. In this work
		we present a Java-based implementation for LISP which is open-source,
		modular, and features a plugin mechanism that enables simple integration of
		new functionality. It provides behavior for LISP nodes, infrastructure
		nodes, and various extensions, it is easily portable, can be run on various
		operating systems and platforms, in particular on Android smartphones. The
		demo illustrates LISP-based communication including the extensions
		mentioned above. In addition, the extensibility is demonstrated by a plugin
		for a statistics application.</div>
