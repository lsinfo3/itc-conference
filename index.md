# ITC 31 in Budapest: Networked Systems and Services

The INTERNATIONAL TELETRAFFIC CONGRESS ITC 31, to be held August 27-29, 2019 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary, is the 31st edition of this international flagship congress in the field of networking science and practice. ITC was founded back in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers who were willing to deploy networks in a holistic way. Since then, it has estab­lished a multi-decade tradition as the primary forum for presenting and dis­cussing the latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements.

### Open Access and Digital Libraries

ITC follows an open access strategy. Accepted ITC conference and workshop papers can be downloaded from the open [ITC digital library](https://itc-conference.org/itc-library.html). Accepted and presented papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Since ITC retains the copyrights, the papers will also be accessible for free even in those public databases like [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp). This helps to increase the visibility and accessibility of accepted papers.
