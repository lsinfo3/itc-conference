**Welcome Message from ITC 34 General Chairs**
----------------------------------------------

On behalf of the Executive Committee, it is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 34th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC'34), Shenzhen, China, on September 14-16, 2022.  As the first international conference in networking science and practice, ITC was founded in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers willing to deploy networks in a holistic way. During the past 67 years, it has served as a forum for all theoretical fundamentals and engineering practices for large-scale deployment and operation of communication and information networks. Following the successful 19th ITC’2005 in Beijing and 25th ITC'2013 in Shanghai, the 34th ITC'2022 comes back to China again in another most innovative city of Shenzhen under the theme of "Teletraffic Engineering for Smart Networking". Despite the COVID-19 spread, you are warmly welcome to "see" the miracle city of Shenzhen and the appealing ICT industry there led by Huawei, ZTE, Tencent, Dajiang, etc.  

The ITC'34 is jointly organized by the Chinese University of Hong Kong at Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ) and Tsinghua University (THU) under the supports from Chinese Institute of Communications (CIC) and International Advisory Council (IAC) of ITC.  The technical program consists of two keynote speeches, 18 invited speeches, 13 technical papers, one panel session, one tutorial session, one joint workshop with two plenary speeches and 7 workshop papers, disseminating the latest research and development results in the areas of teletraffic and networking science.  By taking this opportunity, we would like to express our sincere thanks and appreciations to all the authors, technical committee members, and anonymous reviewers, in particular to all the committee chairs.  The conference would never be possible without your great and exceptional contributions.  

We strongly believe you will find the technical program of ITC'34 very stimulating and inspiring, and cordially invite all of you to join us and interact with the distinguished speakers and panelists.  Once again, welcome to ITC'34 and enjoy the conference.
