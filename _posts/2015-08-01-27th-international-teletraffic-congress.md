ITC is an annual event that provides a venue for researchers from academia and industry interested in design and control of communication networks, protocols, and applications. ITC solicits original contributions, especially contributions that address novel issues, pioneer disruptive paradigms, or propose innovative models and techniques. Furthermore, contributions that provide important insights on real-world networking problems, e.g., based on measurements, application of analytical techniques or simulations, are strongly encouraged.<br/>
The 27th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC27) will be held in Ghent, Belgium, from September 08-10, 2015.
