## CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Open source book on "100 Most Frequent Errors in Performance Evaluation"
[http://100errors.info](http://100errors.info/)

### Scope

There are typical errors in performance evaluation which are reported and summarized here in order to prevent researchers from those pitfalls. The 100 errors are also interesting for PhD students as well as bachelor and master students who are evaluating the performance of systems by means of measurements, simulations, experiments, or analytical approaches.<br/>
We are looking for contributions to such typical examples, for example like the random generation of points in a circle or the simulation of non-stationary Poisson processes, see [example](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnwxMDBtb3N0ZnJlcXVlbnRlcnJvcnN8Z3g6MTlkMTg2OTRjZmQwNTMyMA).

### Submission

Submissions will be peer reviewed. Authors are requested to use the following [latex template](https://sites.google.com/site/100mostfrequenterrors/home/template.zip?attredirects=0&d=1) for their contributions. Contributions shall be between 2 and 6 pages long. For submitting an article, please complete the [online form](https://sites.google.com/site/100mostfrequenterrors/submission/form) or send an email to [contact@100errors.info](mailto:contact@100errors.info). Please have a look at the [list of errors](https://sites.google.com/site/100mostfrequenterrors/list) if a similar contribution is already submitted. Accepted contributions will appear in an open-source book.
