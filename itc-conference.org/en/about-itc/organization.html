	<div><p style="text-align: justify;">The            International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) was created in 1955            by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.i-teletraffic.org/about-itc/arne-jensen/" title="Opens internal link in current window">Arne Jensen</a>  to initially cater to the emerging need to understand and model traffic  in telephone            networks using stochastic methodologies, and to  bring together researchers            with these considerations as a  common theme. Over the years, it has            broaden its scope to  address a wide spectrum ranging from the mathematical            theory  of traffic processes, stochastic system modelling and analysis,             traffic and performance measurements, network management, traffic  engineering            to network capacity planning and cost  optimization, including network            economics and reliability for  various types of networks.<br/>Today, with its conferences, specialist seminars,  regional seminars,            training courses and publications, the ITC  aims at a worldwide forum            for all questions related to  network and service performance, management,            and assessment,  both present and futuristic. The notion of traffic is            broadly  used to encompass data traffic from the MAC layer all the way             to application traffic in the application layer. The scope of ITC is             thus ranging all issues embedding operations, design,  planning, economics            and performance analysis of current and  emerging communication networks            and services, to be addressed  by applying a variety of tools from different            fields, such  as Stochastic Processes, Information theory, Control theory,             Signal and Processing, Game theory and optimization techniques,  Statistical            methodologies and Artifical Intelligence  techniques. The target audience            of such issues is experts  from research organizations, universities,            equipment vendors  and suppliers, network operators, service providers,            system  integrators and international technical organizations, guaranteeing             a well-balanced contribution from theory, application, and  practice.            The general goal remains to bring researchers and  practitioners            together toward operational understanding of  all types of current and            future networks.	 	 		 		 			<br/>The ITC is ruled by the <i>International Advisory Council</i> (IAC)               which gathers a number of technical experts, from  universities and              the research arms of key corporations in  the industry, from countries having a strong tradition in teletraffic               development. The <a href="iac-members.html" title="Opens internal link in current window" data-gentics-aloha-repository="node-repository" data-gentics-aloha-object-id="90e3291f-1d4a-402c-a60e-0c964ea748ab">IAC</a> responsibilities are to disseminate information              on teletraffic which is of interest for the whole community and:</p><ul><li> to select the locations of Plenary Congresses and to ensure their high-level technical programme ;</li><li>to support Specialist Seminars on specific topics of current interest ;</li><li>to promote Regional Seminars for the dissemination of teletraffic concepts in developing countries ;</li><li>to  facilitate the liaison activity with the ITU through participation in  the standardization process and in the Development Programme.<br/><br/></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The              technical program and the  organization of each ITC event remains within              the  responsibilities of the hosting country, but with significant               IAC support to guarantee that the event is consistent with the  quality              standards established during the previous  congresses.<br/>The            ITC Plenary Congresses were scheduled  tri-annually from 1955 until 1995            when the interval became  bi-annual to account for the ever-accelerating            development of  network technologies, products and services and the associated             dramatic increases in network demands. Similarly, to better cover the             impact of dramatic changes undergoing in the field of  computer and communication            systems, networks and usage, it  has been decided to hold the Plenary            Congress on an annual  basis from 2009.</p></div>
