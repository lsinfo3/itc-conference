	<div><h1>History of the ITC</h1><br/></div>

<div class=" typo3-neos-nodetypes-text">
	<div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">1955 - 2015: ITC celebrates its 60th anniversary!</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">It is a pleasure to  announce that ITC as the first conference in networking science &amp;  practice celebrates its 60th anniversary with special events to be held  during the next edition, hosted in Ghent, Belgium, on September 8th-10th, 2015.  ITC has steered the evolutions in communications since its creation in  1955 and remains at the forefront of innovation regarding modeling and  performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past 60 years,  ITC has provided a forum for leading researchers from academia and  industry to present and discuss key technological and methodological  advances in the design, performance evaluation and control of  communication networks like the Internet. Today, ITC addresses the  emerging paradigms such as an increasing diversity of distributed  applications and services over various media like mobile/optical  networks, enabling new markets and economy. For example, the convergence  between networking and information technology enabled by virtualization  techniques and cloud architectures is providing new stakes in terms of  network architecture and service operations. Beyond performance and  Quality of Service (QoS), different challenges like Quality of  Experience (QoE), economic aspects and business models, energy savings,  but also societal impact are considered. <br/>In 1955, ITC emerged as  the conference for all theoretical fundamentals and engineering  practices regarding the large-scale deployments of telecommunications  networks. For long time, ITC was the sole venue that brought together at  large scale researchers from industry, network operators and service  providers, as well as scientists from academia. These groups are the  strong traditional roots of ITC. For decades, the scientific roots of  communications traffic have been primarily based on the theory of  probability and stochastic processes, modelling and performance  evaluation and gave rise to the neologism ‘teletraffic’. However, along  with time and technology and service evolutions, additional scientific  areas have been considered to address issues raised by network design,  economics and regulatory challenges.<br/>ITC congresses were  organized all over the world and visited 16 different countries while  Specialist Seminars were organized in 14 different countries.  Additionally, as part of its objective to disseminate know-how and  expertise, ITC has set up regional seminars in 11 developing countries  including Africa and Oceania, at a time when opening to the world was  not as common as today. ITU was then the leading standardization body in  telecommunications and the huge expertise developed at ITC fostered the  liaison activity for standardization at ITU-T and the development  program in connection with ITU-D. </p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">The evolution of technologies of the 20<sup>th</sup> century </h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">ITC has been witnessing  the change of communication and networking technologies which are  reflected in the proceedings and programs of the congresses. The  specialist seminars and the motto of the congresses thereby reflect the  hot topics of that time and the evolution. Selected topics of the 70’s,  80’s and 90’s were</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">1998: Traffic Issues related to Multimedia and Nomadic Communications<br/>1995: Traffic Modeling and Measurement in Broadband and Mobile Communications<br/>1990: Broadband Technologies: Architectures, Applications, Control and Performance<br/>1986: ISDN Traffic Issues<br/>1984: Fundamentals of Teletraffic Theory<br/>1977: Modeling of SPC Exchanges and Data Networks</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Recent topics in the 21st century </h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the rise of the Internet, new networking paradigms and technologies but also new challenges emerged: </p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">2014: Towards a Sustainable World<br/>2013: Energy Efficient and Green Networking<br/>2010: Multimedia Applications - Traffic, Performance and QoE<br/>2009: Network Virtualization - Concepts and Performance<br/>2008: Future Internet Design and Experimental Facilities<br/>2008: Quality of Experience<br/>2002: Internet Traffic Engineering and Traffic Management </p></div>

	<div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">The origin of the teletraffic congresses</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the late forties  and early fifties it became clear to many of  those working on traffic  theory questions that closer contact between  researchers in the field  would be of great value. A meeting at which  people could present their  work, where ideas and experience could be  exchanged, and, not least,  where personal contacts could be made, was  considered to be greatly  desirable. In the autumn of 1953 an  organizational committee was formed  consisting of<br/>E. Brockmeyer, Denmark<br/>C. Jacobaus, Sweden<br/>A. Jensen, Denmark<br/>L. Kosten, Holland<br/>N. Rodenburg, Holland<br/><br/>The   committee considered that Denmark should be host nation for the first   congress in view of the decisive contribution made within telephone   traffic research by A. K. Eriang. Denmark also undertook with enthusiasm   to organize he first teletraffic congress. It was held in Copenhagen  on  June 21-23, 1955, and was attended by 69 delegates from 13  countries.  Twenty-six papers were presented and discussed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The  delegates  considered generally that the congress had been very  successful and  fruitful and it appeared self-evident that future  congresses should be  arranged.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the first congress a council entitled the International Advisory Council (IAC)   was set up. From the start IAC has been composed of researchers from   the leading countries within the field. The chairman has been Professor   Dr. Arne Jensen from 1955-1991, who has also played the greatest part  in  drawing up the lines for the congresses; more than any other he has  set  his mark upon them.<br/>The responsibility for the organization and   arrangement of the various congresses has rested with the host   countries. Through great generosity on the part of administrations and   industry in the various host countries the congresses have always been   very well organized. Highly appreciated programmes for the wives of   delegates have been a common feature. All events, as also the congresses   themselves, have been free of charge to the delegates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Source: ERICSSON REVIEW Vol. 50, No. 4, 1973</i></p></div>

	<div><h2>Development of the ITC Congresses</h2><p>The ITC Plenary Congresses  were scheduled tri-annually from 1955 until 1997 when the interval  became bi-annual to account for the ever-accelerating development of  network technologies, products and services and the associated dramatic  increases in network demands. Similarly, to better cover the impact of  dramatic changes undergoing in the field of computer and communication  systems, networks and usage, it has been decided to hold the Plenary  Congress on an annual basis from 2009.<br/></p><p><b>1955 – 1991: Arne Jensen</b></p><p>The  first ITC took place in 1955 in Copenhagen and subsequent congresses  have been held at three yearly intervals in The Hague, Paris, London,  New York, Munich, Stockholm, Melbourne, Torremolinos, Montreal, Kyoto,  Torino and Copenhagen (again). The present vitality of the ITC, which  promotes specialist and regional seminars in addition to the triennial  congresses, owes much to the energy and enthusiasm of Professor Arne  Jensen. Between the first and last congresses in Copenhagen, both of  which he chaired, he has overseen an impressive development in the  science (or art) of teletraffic theory and engineering as chairman of  the International Advisory Council.</p><p><b>1991 – 2007: Paul J. Kühn</b></p><p>At  the end of the ITC 13 in 1991 in Copenhagen, Arne Jensen became  Chairman Emeritus of the IAC. He left the executive responsibility for  the ITC to a new chairman, Professor Paul Kühn. ITC 14 was the first  congress under a new chairman. It differed in two important respects  from its predecessors. Firstly, the papers to be presented were selected  by an international programme committee after a thorough review of the  full paper (and not just an abstract) by three independent referees. It  was possible to accept only slightly more than half of the submitted  papers. The high rejection rate does, however, ensured an exceptionally  high standard for the work presented in ITC 14. The second innovation  concerned the congress schedule. ITC 14 took place from Monday to  Friday, breaking with the traditional Wednesday to Wednesday schedule of  previous congresses. </p><p><b>2007 - 2015: Prosper Chemouil</b></p><p>He  was elected in 2007 at ITC 20 in Ottawa where he chaired his first IAC  meeting. Since ITC 21 in Paris, 2009, the ITC conference is held  annually. ITC as annual event brings together researchers interested in  understanding and improving the way traffic is handled in communication  networks. Additionally, the conference comes at the right time to honor  the centenary of the publication of the Danish mathematician A.K.  Erlang’s famous article in 1909: “The Theory of Probabilities and  Telephone Conversations”. This article, considered to be the first  publication on queuing theory, was doubtlessly one of the cornerstones  in the creation of the International Teletraffic Congress.<br/></p><p><b>Some Milestones</b></p><ul><li>1955: ITC 1 Copenhagen<br/>First ITC; Review of abstracts; Schedule: Wednesday to Wednesday</li><li>1978: First ITC Specialist Seminar</li><li>1991: ITC 13 Copenhagen<br/>Arne  Jensen chaired his last ITC in his home country.

	<div><h2>Recent changes in the IAC and ITC Conference in 2016<br/></h2><p>Since  its creation in 1955, the ITC is steered by an International Advisory  Council (IAC). The role of the IAC is quite significant in the choice  and the follow-up of all ITC-organized events. During the successful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.itc27.org/">ITC 27</a> in  Ghent, Belgium, we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of ITC, which makes  ITC the oldest still-running event in ICT. It was a perfect opportunity  to hand over the responsibility of the IAC to a new team that has been  progressively involved in the IAC since last year. The former IAC did an  excellent job and was chaired by Prosper Chemouil with the very strong  support and dedication of: Luigi Fratta, Ulf Körner, Deep Medhi, Hiroshi  Saito, Phuoc Tran-Gia, Hans Van den Berg, Villy-Baek Iversen, Peter  Key, Paul J Kuehn, Xiongjian Liang, Jim Yan. See all honorary IAC members.<br/></p><p>The new IAC team is very motivated and enthusiastic and is chaired by Michela Meo:</p><ul><li>Michela Meo, Politecnico Torino, Italy</li><li>Markus Fiedler, BTH, Sweden</li><li>Tobias Hossfeld, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany</li><li>Fabrice Guillemin, Orange Labs, France</li><li>Michael Menth, University of Tuebingen, Germany</li><li>Zhisheng Niu, Tsinghua University, China</li><li>Dario Rossi, Telecom ParisTech, France</li><li>Benny Van Houdt, University of Antwerp, Belgium</li></ul><p><a target="_blank" href="http://itc28.org/">ITC 28 </a>introduced  also some changes, which are the concept of areas and a demo session.  ITC 28 is structured into eight different areas which address hot topics  in networking. Each area is chaired by two international well  recognized experts in that area. The area chairs have formed a smaller  TPC per area. The idea is that the area chairs invite the experts for  their area, that are experts from the ITC community as well as  well-known experts worldwide. On the one hand, the concept aims at  opening the ITC community and attracting submissions. On the other hand,  the areas help to improve the quality of the review process. The area  chairs assign the reviews to the experts in their domain and evaluate  all papers in their domain. <br/>In addition, we introduced demo sessions  for ITC 28.  The demo session is distinguished only in presentation  format. ‘Demo papers’ are simply papers whose content is best understood  by an audience if the material is demonstrated rather than presented in  a slideshow. With the demo session, we aim at attracting more  submissions and make ITC attractive for other communities.</p></div>
