	<div><h2>Welcome Message from ITC 30 General Chairs</h2></div>
</div>
<div class=" typo3-neos-nodetypes-text">
	<div><p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome Message from General Co-Chairs<br/>On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we are delighted to welcome you to the 30th Inter-national Teletraffic Congress (ITC 30) to be held on September 4-7, 2018, at the University of Vienna, Austria.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ITC was founded back in 1955 by enthusiastic scientists and engineers who were willing to deploy networks holistically Since then, it has established a multi-decade tradition as the primary forum for presenting and discussing the latest technical advances in the broad areas of teletraffic models, network systems, and measurements. Its inherent roots in solid metho-dological foundations have allowed ITC to adapt constantly its technological focus without losing its original identity. Today, ITC continues to serve as a broad and lively community for researchers and practitioners dedicated to advancing the limits of knowledge in networking.<br/>ITC 30 focuses on the future smart world and how to build it using recent advances in networking science &amp; practice, including key challenges arising from the upcoming inter-connection of massive numbers of devices, sensors, and human beings. To this end, cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation will be presented which will address all areas of networking, ranging from traffic engineering and control with application also to emerging softwarized/virtualized network paradigms, up to innovative wireless scenari-os brought about by the emergence of 5G and IoT systems. Moreover, ITC 30 aims to bridge the gap between performance modelling and real-life operational aspects, including research works which leverage measurement data to provide a better understanding of the wired and wireless networks’ operation under realistic conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We are happy that Debasis Mitra (Columbia University, USA) discusses the future smart world in his keynote on “An Engineer’s Perspective on Some Societal Problems”. In Debasis’ view, this engineer relies on models, analysis and model-based experimentation to explore some societal problems, including the role of knowledge, its nurture and impact in high-tech industries, the survival of Best Effort services in the Internet in an uncertain regulatory environment, as well as inter-organizational working for content delivery in an increasingly content-centric Internet.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As one of the highlights of ITC 30, the ITC 30 Networking Science Vision Day will be organi-zed on Wednesday, September 5, 2018, presenting several top experts from the networking community who will offer their views and visions on the future smart world and the ro-le of networking research in it. The key question is “Networking Science - Where Are We Heading To?”, and Philippe Jacquet (Nokia Bell Labs, France) will focus his corresponding talk on “Wireless and the City”. Despite being the place where the majority of the human population lives and interacts, cities are in general among the worst environments for ra-dio communication. Hence, this talk reviews the theories of wireless networks at the scale of a full city. Alexandre Proutiere (KTH Stockholm, Sweden) considers “Data-driven Deci-sions in Communication Systems”, surveying recent advances in the use of online learning methods on the design of optimal (and sometimes distributed) radio access protocols in wi-reless networks as well as enhanced resource allocation schemes for better Quality of Expe-rience. Mikaël Touati (Orange Labs, France) discusses “Networks and Market Mechanisms”, in particular, mechanisms used to match, allocate or trade resources in markets and survey mechanisms with and without money, their use-cases, properties and solution concepts. Piet Van Mieghem (TU Delft, The Netherlands) overviews “Network Science and Telecommunications”. From the perspective of telecommunications, his personal view on the history of Network Science and its fascinations is provided. Then, the epidemic spread on networks, a way of diffusing information in a network, is discussed. The sessions of the Vision Day will be chaired by Helmut Leopold, Head of the Center for Digital Safety &amp; Security at the Austri-an Institute of Technology (AIT), who will bring in his broad experience in the field and thus will additionally stimulate the discussions, which are complemented by the perspectives of young researchers as well as a session on doctoral dissertations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Network Science Vision Day will be closed by the ITC 30 award session in which the ITC Rising Scholar Award and the Arne Jensen Lifetime Achievement Awards will be given to the recipients. The ITC Rising Scholar Award has been created in order to recognize young researchers with significant contributions to the ITC Community in the field of performan-ce, traffic modelling, and control in communication networks and networking science. The Arne Jensen Lifetime Achievement Award is given to an individual who has provided an ex-ceptional contribution to traffic modelling, control and performance, and dedication to the teletraffic community.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This year’s ITC is arranged around four different areas: Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization Chairs; Network Measurements and Big Data; Networking Architectures and Paradigms; and Wireless and Cellular Networks. The ITC technical program contains 18 full papers and 5 demo and poster papers across these areas. ITC 30 has a dedicated session with 5 accepted papers on doctoral dissertations which are related to the ITC topics in the field of performance, traffic modelling, and control in communication networks and networking science. The idea of the dissertation session is to give PhD students a forum to present their PhD to a larger audience during the ITC main conference. In addition, 2 PhD work-in-progress papers will be presented as part of the ITC conference. We would like to thank the chairs of the PhD session, Ramón Agüero (University of Cantabria, Spain), Thomas Bauschert (TU Chemnitz, Germany), Ognjen Dobrijevic´ (University of Zagreb, Croatia), and Andreas Timm-Giel (Hamburg University of Technology, Germany).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the ITC conference, we also sponsor a workshop dedicated to “Network Cal-culus and Applications” (NetCal 2018). Network Calculus is a branch of queueing theory which aims at exploring the bounding behavior for queues. The workshop is composed of 10 original papers reporting mature or early-stage results in network calculus theory and its applications to different areas. Jean-Yves Le Boudec (EPFL, Switzerland) will give a keyno-te talk on “Network Calculus: From Integrated Services to Deterministic Networking”. We would like to thank the workshop organizers for this successful event at ITC: Yuming Ji-ang (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway), Jens Schmitt (University of Kaiserslautern, Germany), and Markus Fidler (Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We also thank ITC’s International Advisory Committee (IAC) for their support of student travel grants and best paper awards. The IAC has graciously decided to offer a number of travel grants available to full-time students. We are also very grateful to IFIP TC6 WG6.6 for sponsoring additional student travel grants. ITC 30 has set up two prestigious awards: The Best Paper Award will be granted to the best contribution presented at ITC 30, while the Best Student Paper Award will be conferred upon the best paper whose first author is a full-time student at the time of submission of the paper and is the presenter. These awards will be selected based on the scientific merit of the publication as well as the quality of the oral presentation at ITC 30.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A successful conference requires dedication and engagement of many people. We would like to especially recognize the never-ending efforts of the three TPC Co-Chairs, Eitan Altman (INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, France), Giuseppe Bianchi (University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy), and Thomas Zinner (TU Berlin, Germany), who have done a magnificent job in compiling this excellent technical program and who have put a lot of efforts and personal enthusiasm to make ITC 30 a lively and attractive event. Thank you so much!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our thanks go to the Workshop Chairs, Chiara Buratti (University of Bologna, Italy) and Poul E. Heegaard (NTNU Trondheim, Norway), and to the Demo and Poster Chairs, Micha-el Jarschel (Nokia, Munich, Germany) and Corinna Schmitt (Universität der Bundeswehr München, Germany) for all their efforts. We thank Christopher Metter and Florian Metzger (both University of Würzburg, Germany), who have served as Web &amp; EDAS Co-Chairs. Ra-vi R. Mazumdar (University of Waterloo, Canada) as Award Chair will lead the best paper award selection process. Prosper Chemouil (Orange Labs Networks, France) organized the student travel grant jury and reviewed the student travel grant applications. Our special thanks go to Michela Meo (Politecnico di Torino, Italy) as International Advisory Council Chair of ITC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our Publicity Co-Chairs, Pedro Casas (AIT Vienna, Austria), Frank Restuccia (Northeastern University, Boston, USA), and Sheng Zhou (Tsinghua University, China), have done a gre-at job in disseminating information about ITC 30 throughout the world. Our Publication Co-Chairs, Matthias Hirth (University of Würzburg, Germany) and Lea Skorin-Kapov (Uni-versity of Zagreb, Croatia), very efficiently organized the publication process with the CPS publisher and took care of the technical sponsorship with IEEE ComSoc and ACM SIG-COMM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We greatly appreciate everyone who submitted papers to the conference, particularly tho-se who will be presenting their work at ITC 30. The IEEE, IEEE Communications Society, IFIP - International Federation for Information Processing, and the Information Technology Society within VDE (ITG VDE) kindly agreed to technically co-sponsor ITC 30, and ACM SIGCOMM helped us through their in-cooperation agreement. Last but not least we are ve-ry grateful for the financial support by the Faculty of Computer Science of University of Vienna, as well as the Austrian Electrotechnical Association (OVE) and the City of Vienna for their generous support with organizing the social events. And of course, we thank all members of the COSY Research Group of University of Vienna for the local arrangements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Having finished all preparations, we are now looking forward to a wonderful scientific event in a magnificent city, and would like to cordially welcome all participants of ITC 30 here in Vienna!</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p style="text-align: right;">Peter Reichl (University of Vienna, Austria) <br/>Tobias Hoßfeld (University of Würzburg, Germany)<br/>September 2018</p></div>

	<div><h2>Welcome Message from ITC 30 Technical Program Co-Chairs</h2></div>
</div>
<div class=" typo3-neos-nodetypes-text">
	<div><p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome Message from Technical Program Co-Chairs<br/>On behalf of the Technical Program Committee, we are delighted to welcome you to ITC 30, the 30th International Teletraffic Congress. ITC 30 takes place between September 4th -7th, 2018 in Vienna, Austria.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ITC boasts a rich tradition since its founding in 1955 and has evolved into one of the most re-putable networking conferences with a particular emphasis on rigorous methodology. Over more than 50 years ITC has provided a forum for leading researchers from academia and in-dustry to present and discuss key technological and methodological advances in the design, performance evaluation and control of communication networks, protocols and applications and in traffic measurement and management. ITC 30 continues this tradition by featuring the theme “Teletraffic in a Smart World”, which is well aligned with the proliferation of the Internet of Things and the corresponding challenges to networked systems and services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of organization, ITC 30 adopted the thematic “Areas” implemented by the previous ITC conferences. Each Area was run by an individual Technical Program Committee whose expertise best suited the Area’s topics. ITC 30 was structured into four regular Areas and one Demo and Poster Session.<br/></p></div>

</div>
<div class=" typo3-neos-nodetypes-text">
	<div><p style="text-align: justify;">ITC 30 attracted 46 full paper submissions across all areas and 9 demo and poster submissi-ons. The authors of the submitted papers were from 25 different countries, out of which 79%were from Europe, 8% from the USA and Canada, 13% from Asia/Pacific and Latin America.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Each submitted full paper was reviewed by at least three experts manually assigned by the Area and TPC chairs. In special cases, when the discussion of reviewers did not converge, additional expert reviews were requested. In total, there were 156 completed reviews for the 46 submitted full papers, i.e., an average of 3.4 reviews per paper. The area chairs and TPC members fostered discussions to converge the reviewers’ recommendations towards a decision. The area chairs provided a ranked list of papers with suggestions for papers to be either accepted, rejected, or further discussed. A full-day online TPC meeting was held on May, 7th, 2018. The purpose of the online meeting was to jointly discuss the lists provided by the Area Chairs, and especially to make final decisions accounting for the Areas altogether. The TPC decided to accept 18 out of the 46 submitted full papers, with the overall acceptance rate of 39.1%. The submitted poster and demo papers were reviewed by at least three experts manually assigned by the area chairs. Based on the reviewers’ recommendations and further discussions the Area and TPC chairs decided to accept 5 out of 9 submitted papers resulting in an acceptance rate for posters and demos of 55.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To enhance the integration of early-stage researchers a dedicated session on doctoral disser-tations related to the ITC topics was newly established. The idea of the dissertation session is to give PhD students a forum to present their PhD to a larger audience during the ITC main conference. Each of the papers received at least three reviews. Based on the recom-mendations of the reviewers and additional discussions by the TPC chairs, 5 papers out of 5 submitted papers were accepted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ITC program is complemented by four invited papers highlighting teletraffic research in the area of next generation networks and wireless networks. Each of the paper received three reviews and was discussed by Area and TPC chairs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The accepted papers are to be presented during the main conference in a single-track format. A selection of the best papers will be published by the international scientific journal Perfor-mance Evaluation in a special issue, after being subject to an additional refereeing process according to the journal’s standards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ITC 30 was possible thanks to the significant effort of many people to whom we would like to express our sincere gratitude. Researchers submitted interesting technical papers; TPC members and reviewers ensured a high quality of the reviewing process; keynote speakers have provided additional value to the conference. We are also grateful to the members of the International Advisory Council (IAC) of the ITC for their support. We further express our special thanks to all co-chairs of the various activities and committees, and to the sponsors. We finally thank all attendees, whose participation is always essential to the success of the conference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p style="text-align: right;">Eitan Altman (INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, France) <br/>Giuseppe Bianchi (University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy) <br/>Thomas Zinner (TU Berlin, Germany)<br/>September 2018</p></div>
