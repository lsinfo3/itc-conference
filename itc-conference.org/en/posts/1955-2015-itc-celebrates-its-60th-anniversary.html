	<div><p>It is a pleasure to announce that ITC as  the first conference in networking science &amp; practice celebrates  its 60th anniversary with special events to be held during the next  edition, hosted in <a target="_blank" title="Opens external link in new window" href="http://www.itc27.org/">Ghent, Belgium, on September 8th-10th, 2015</a>.  ITC has steered the evolutions in communications since its creation in  1955 and remains at the forefront of innovation regarding modeling and  performance.<br/>Over the past 60 years, ITC has provided a forum for  leading researchers from academia and industry to present and discuss  key technological and methodological advances in the design, performance  evaluation and control of communication networks like the Internet.  Today, ITC addresses the emerging paradigms such as an increasing  diversity of distributed applications and services over various media  like mobile/optical networks, enabling new markets and economy. For  example, the convergence between networking and information technology  enabled by virtualization techniques and cloud architectures is  providing new stakes in terms of network architecture and service  operations. Beyond performance and Quality of Service (QoS), different  challenges like Quality of Experience (QoE), economic aspects and  business models, energy savings, but also societal impact are  considered.<br/>In 1955, ITC emerged as the conference for all  theoretical fundamentals and engineering practices regarding the  large-scale deployments of telecommunications networks. For long time,  ITC was the sole venue that brought together at large scale researchers  from industry, network operators and service providers, as well as  scientists from academia. These groups are the strong traditional roots  of ITC. For decades, the scientific roots of communications traffic have  been primarily based on the theory of probability and stochastic  processes, modelling and performance evaluation and gave rise to the  neologism ‘teletraffic’. However, along with time and technology and  service evolutions, additional scientific areas have been considered to  address issues raised by network design, economics and regulatory  challenges.<br/>ITC congresses were organized all over the world and  visited 16 different countries while Specialist Seminars were organized  in 14 different countries. Additionally, as part of its objective to  disseminate know-how and expertise, ITC has set up regional seminars in  11 developing countries including Africa and Oceania, at a time when  opening to the world was not as common as today. ITU was then the  leading standardization body in telecommunications and the huge  expertise developed at ITC fostered the liaison activity for  standardization at ITU-T and the development program in connection with  ITU-D.<span></span></p><h2>The evolution of technologies of the 20th century</h2><p>ITC  has been witnessing the change of communication and networking  technologies which are reflected in the proceedings and programs of the  congresses. The specialist seminars and the motto of the congresses  thereby reflect the hot topics of that time and the evolution. Selected  topics of the 70’s, 80’s and 90’s were</p><p>1998: Traffic Issues related to Multimedia and Nomadic Communications<br/>1995: Traffic Modeling and Measurement in Broadband and Mobile Communications<br/>1990: Broadband Technologies: Architectures, Applications, Control and Performance<br/>1986: ISDN Traffic Issues<br/>1984: Fundamentals of Teletraffic Theory<br/>1977: Modeling of SPC Exchanges and Data Networks<span></span><span></span></p><h2>Recent topics in the 21st century</h2><p>With the rise of the Internet, new networking paradigms and technologies but also new challenges emerged:</p><p>2014: Towards a Sustainable World<br/>2013: Energy Efficient and Green Networking<br/>2010: Multimedia Applications - Traffic, Performance and QoE<br/>2009: Network Virtualization - Concepts and Performance<br/>2008: Future Internet Design and Experimental Facilities<br/>2008: Quality of Experience<br/>2002: Internet Traffic Engineering and Traffic Management </p><h2>ITC today in 2015</h2><p>This  year the 27th ITC congress takes place in Ghent, Belgium. The theme of  ITC 2015 is “Traffic, Performance and Big Data” reflecting the recent  challenges today, for instance exploiting huge volumes of data available  from connected devices for business, network operations, services.<br/>With  the emergence of the Internet of Things, the number of devices being  connected to the Internet is steadily growing and huge amounts of data  are being generated worldwide. Big data brings new traffic and  performance related challenges and calls for a deep revisit of the  methodological tools that were traditionally used for performance  evaluation and traffic engineering. New models and approaches are needed  to investigate big data characteristics in terms of volume, velocity  and variability and their impact on network performance; new solutions  have to be designed to efficiently and securely manage information; new  techniques are needed to support all phases of network planning, design  and optimization.<br/>ITC still represents a wide and lively community of  researchers and practitioners dedicated to push back the limits of  knowledge in the area of networkin. As such, ITC is regularly organizing  events like Congresses, Specialist Seminars and Workshops in order to  discuss the latest changes in the modelling, design and performance of  communication systems, networks and services. Today more than ever, ITC  is attracting participants from all over the world. </p><p>Join  the ITC community to celebrate this significant anniversary and prepare  the future of ICT in the attractive city of Ghent, Belgium!<br/><a target="_blank" href="http://www.itc27.org/">www.itc27.org</a></p><p><b><br/>Prosper Chemouil</b>, Orange Labs, France - Chair of the ITC International Advisory Council<br/><b>Tobias Hossfeld</b>, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany  - Member of the ITC International Advisory Council<br/><b>Michela Meo</b>, Politecnico di Torino, Italy -  Chair-elect of the ITC International Advisory Council</p></div>
