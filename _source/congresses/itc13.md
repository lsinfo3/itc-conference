## ITC 13 Proceedings

Within this volume the rapid evolutionary changes currently pervading all telecommunication fields are explored. Changes in teletraffic technology, such as from analog to digital, from dedicated systems to service integrated networks insure a steady increase in teletraffic research activities in the near future. Included in the over 1000 pages of high quality research reports, are six in-depth workshops organized by renown experts in the fields of ATM, stochastic modelling, systems engineering and traffic engineering, future telecom scenarios, teletraffic problems of developing countries, and history of teletraffic. Keynote speakers were given the opportunity of first choices among the papers submitted ensuring excellent quality among the papers included.
