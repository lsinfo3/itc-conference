## Arne Jensen Lifetime Achievement Awards
The Arne Jensen Lifetime Award has been created in memory of Arne Jensen, Founder of the International Teletraffic Congress (ITC) and Chair of the International Advisory Council (IAC) from its inception in 1955 until 1991. The Award is presented at ITCs to an individual who has provided exceptional contribution to traffic modeling, control and performance, and dedication to the teletraffic community.

## ITC Rising Scholar Award

The International Advisory Council (IAC) of the ITC decided to set up a new award: the ITC Rising Scholar Award. The goal of the ITC Rising Scholar Award is to recognize young researchers with significant contributions to the ITC Community in the field of performance, traffic modeling and control in communication networks and networking science.

There is an open [call for nominations.](/awards/rising-scholar-award.html) More information on the call for nomination: [https://itc-conference.org/awards/rising-scholar-award.html](/awards/rising-scholar-award.html)









**ITC Rising Scholar Award 2018**

It is our pleasure to award the 2018 ITC Rising Scholar Award to [Dr. Arpan Mukhopadhyay](/bio/arpan-mukhopadhyay.html), post-doctoral researcher in the Computer Communations and Applications Laboratory-2 of Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, for fundamental mathematical results on mean-field approximations. His extremely strong and solid theoretic contributions extend a versatile performance analysis method for a very broad range of applications that are following the original spirit of ITC.
