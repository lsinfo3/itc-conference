## 22nd ITC Specialist Seminar on Energy Efficient and Green Networking

20-22 November 2013, Christchurch, New Zealand

[Homepage](http://www.itcspecialistseminar22.com/)


## Theme of the Specialist Seminar

Once limited to the computing world – specifically, to data centres - energy efficiency has become an issue in telecommunication networks in the recent years, mainly owing to two reasons: the increased attention to environmental aspects, and the growing operational expenditure (OPEX) of Telcos and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Great attention is currently dedicated to energy-efficient “green” networking in both wired and wireless scenarios. A number of techniques have been identified and are continuously being consolidated and improved to reduce the energy consumption in networking equipment, while maintaining at the same time a desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) – and, ultimately, of Quality of Experience (QoE) in the users’ perception – in dependence of the actual carried traffic load. The range of possible actions spans from the design aspects (re-engineering of both silicon and network architecture to reduce complexity) to the on-line operation at small and large time scales (dynamic adaptation of devices’ energy consumption-performance trade-off and “smart sleeping” techniques). While Green Networking is pacing to become a mature bulk of technologies, many aspects still need to be investigated to harmonize its presence in the complex scenario of the Future Internet.

This ITC Specialist Seminar is technically sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society. The papers will be archived in the IEEE Xplore. The conference aims at providing a forum for discussion of timely and relevant aspects concerning wired and wireless green networks.
