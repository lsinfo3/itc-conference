## Author registration

"ITC - Author Registration" is specifically set up for authors presenting papers at ITC 31. For your paper to be included in the final programme and to be published in the ITC 31 Proceedings, at least 1 author needs to register before the **deadline of June 17, 2019** at full rate. Papers not covered by any registration by that deadline will automatically be removed from the final programme. If you choose "Author Registration" you will be asked to provide up to 2 paper numbers on which you are listed as (co-)author and which consequently will be secured in the programme.

## Open access

ITC follows an open access strategy. Accepted ITC conference and workshop papers can be downloaded from the open ITC digital library. In addition, ITC makes the effort to index accepted papers in public A&I databases. By getting sponsorship of technical communities like IEEE and ACM, as well as sticking to corresponding rules with respect to technical quality, papers of previous ITC editions were included in the corresponding databases IEEE Xplore and ACM DL.

Since ITC retains the copyrights, it is possible to make the papers accessible for free even in those public databases. This helps to increase the visibility and accessibility of accepted papers.
