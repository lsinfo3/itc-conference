# Call for Papers

Find the .pdf version [here](https://itc31.org/_Resources/Persistent/a29c768006a95aed29573c9ae2ac4b370bdc3d65/CALL-FOR-PAPERS-v8.pdf), plain text below:

For ITC 31, cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking, ranging from traffic engineering and control with application to emerging softwarized/virtualized networ­k paradigms, up to innovative wireless scenarios brought about by the emergence of 5G and IoT systems. We especially encourage original contributions which bridge the gap between performance modeling and real-life operational aspects, including works which leverage measurement data to provide a better understanding of the wired and wireless networks’ operation under realistic conditions.

ITC 31 is specifically focused on four (partially overlapping, non-exclusive) areas:

- Performance Evaluation, Control and Optimization
- Network Measurements, Big Data, Machine Learning for Network Optimization
- Networking Architectures and Paradigms
- Wireless and Cellular Networks

Besides the general submissions ITC31 encourages submissions for Ph.D. session, Poster/Demo session, etc. For detailed information and deadlines check the website frequently. For any questions do not hesitate to contact the conference organization under itc31@lists.t-teletraffic.org.

## Submission guidelines

Full papers must contain original work, currently not under review for other journals or conferences pages, and may comprise of a maximum of 9  A4 (210 mm x 297 mm) pages in 2-column IEEE conference style with a minimum font size of 10 pt. Papers should be submitted electronically using the Easychair online submission system (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itc31). Submitted papers are single-blind reviewed. Please include author names and affiliations in your manuscript as in the provided template under https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors registered with full paper rate until June 17, 2019. Papers not covered by any registration by that deadline will automatically be removed from the final program. Different rules apply for the other submission possibilities like Ph.D. session and Poster/Demo session.

ITC follows an open access strategy. Accepted ITC conference and workshop papers can be downloaded from the open ITC digital library. In addition, ITC makes the effort to index accepted papers in public A&I databases. By getting sponsorship of technical communities like IEEE and ACM, as well as sticking to corresponding rules with respect to technical quality, papers of previous ITC editions were included in the corresponding databases IEEE Xplore and ACM DL. Since ITC retains the copyrights, it is possible to make the papers accessible for free even in those public databases. This helps to increase the visibility and accessibility of accepted papers.
